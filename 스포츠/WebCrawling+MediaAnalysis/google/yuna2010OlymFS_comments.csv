She is incredible. She was robbed at Sochi. I’m still mad about that
She skates naturally like the way she breathes.
Still watching in 2019
"Anyone in 2024?
She'll always stay my #1 favorite ❤"
Never seen a skater land so _cleanly_ on each and every jump. The grace and poise with which she carried herself was amazing.
10 years later... yuna still amazes me. i miss the queen so much!
Still makes me cry after 11 years.
what's really amazing is that she came out of nowhere when there was no infrastructure to support proper training in korea back then she had to practice at a theme park and was going on international competition just with her mom and no sponsor.
after all those years I still miss her on the ice.. she was a true champion
I’ve never seen a more graceful skater than Yuna. Her landings are so delicate. It’s like she’s floating on ice
I named my daughter Yuna... not because of her beauty. I want my daughter to have strong heart like her!
キムヨナちゃんほど美しく演技する人見たことない
She was the greatest legend in figure skating history.
Came back here to watch this magical & flawless olympic performance of Yuna Kim since it's the Winter Olympics again. Nobody skates as effortlessly & gracefully as Queen Yuna. Her artistry & technique is truly on another level and until now I cannot find any other female skater that is as special as her. Her jumps look so beautiful & effortless that it seems like she's just dancing on ice. She is indeed the one & only Queen and will forever be a legend in ladies figure skating.
"She's not skating, she's writing poetry."
"I follow most sports from tennis to Sumo to cricket to hurling. This is the greatest sporting performance I have ever seen.
Pure perfection. She is extremely beautiful too but what really makes it is that sense of humility you get in Yuna. A very 
rare quality in the modern world, sporting or otherwise. May Queen Yuna live forever."
I do not think there will be any better performance ever than this one. History.
"god, her face is incredible. it's so expressive... she looks like she feels a thousand different things through every performance. she's the type of woman who will be the most beautiful in the room even when she's 90 years old"
"All the new skaters do is jump and jump and jump. It's like there's a lost art behind modern figure skating from Yuna's generation. She is just magical. Mind you she comes from a country with no roots in the sport, no facilities, no coaching, and initially no interest in funding her trips to gran prix's and the like. She still managed to win. These days it's just jumping and bought scores from corrupt judges. There may well never be another on Yuna's level. Thank the good Lord for this recording in HD."
"이 무대는 진짜 김연아 커리어하이
그 당시 봤을때도 단 하나의 잔실수 없이 완벽해서 피겨 모르는 내가 봐도 압도적이였음"
"ppl may have broken her record, but honestly no other female skater has really matched hers for me. regardless of all the harder jumps, there was just something so beautiful about her skating"
It’s 2021 and I still think this is the best female program in the history of skating.
"I LOVE how Yuna doesn't take ANY element for granted. She goes into each and every jump with such precision, focus and class. I feel like many skaters take the jumps for granted now doing lutzes and flips like they're nothing and yet they pre-rotate them like loop jumps and get scored as a lutz/flip. Yuna really highlights all the jumps but in the best way there is. She really is the Queen."
10년도 훨씬 지난 지금 봐도 전혀 촌스럽지 않고 세련됨 그 자체네요 연아선수만큼 시원시원하게 점프 뛰는 선수를 찾아볼 수가 없어요 정말 멋집니다
One of the finest moments of Olympic history I've ever witnessed. It was a privilege to watch her skate. Absolutely phenomenal
전국민이 지켜보고있고 금메달을 따야 한다는 압박감때문에 진짜 어깨가 무겁고 힘들었을텐데 아무렇지 않게 두번의 올림픽 클린한게 너무 대견하고 미안한 마음이 많이든다.
"이 정도의 기술 있는 선수는 앞으로 나올 것입니다만
이렇게 아름다운 피겨를 보여줄 선수는 영원히 못 나올 것입니다. 
사랑해요 연아양..........."
テレビ放映であってもキムヨナさんの凄い演技をリアルタイムで見る事ができたのは幸せです。びっくりさせる凄いでかくて幅のあるジャンプ　惹きつける華やかな表現　今でも最高に栄誉の氷上の女王です、
Ive never seen anyone skate/move as graceful and freely than Kim
"first olympic: yuna deserved the gold
second olympic: yuna deserved the gold"
주기적으로 보러오는 영상... 저땐 나도 어려서 체감이 잘 안 됐지만 스무살이라는 어린 나이에 자국민의 관심으로 인한 압박 속에서 완벽한 연기를 했다는 게 참 존경스러움 곧은 정신력과 단단함이 너무 멋있는 사람...
Yuna kim is the greatest figure skater of all time
내가 죽기 전까지 이렇게 아름다운 작품을 다시 볼 수 있을까? 어디 하나 흠 잡을 곳 없이 완벽하게 아름답다.
i have no idea why am i crying watching this beautiful lady...
"It's Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics at the moment. Yet, I'm watching this in Youtube."
"YUNA QUEEN.. 
Even still 2024, I cannot find gorgeous, perfect program like this. In my opinion, this program is the signature of figure skating(woman single). Such a flawless, perfect program! YUNA really miss u really really"
The best free skate in not only Olympic history but figure skating history as well. It doesn't get any better...
Who's here in 2020 ?👍
"난 김연아에게 많은 빚을 졌다. 고시공부로 힘들 때마다 이 영상을 보면 뭔가 힘이 나는 것 같아 수백번도 더 보곤했다. 원하던 꿈을 이루고 이 일에 익숙해질만큼 흐른 8년. 여전히 이 영상을 보면 목표를 향해 노력하던 나도 그녀도 되살아난다. 열정, 젊음까지도."
truly artistic… can’t believe she was only 19 at that time
안녕 여왕. 또 보러 왔어요
"Now skating is dominated by quads, I miss the solid musicality AND technical ability. Her jumps are TEXTBOOK. Kim Yuna will always be the GOAT."
와 지금 봐도 이 극도의 긴장감은..ㄷㄷ... 얼음 가는 소리까지 선명하게 들리는게 저 관중들이 얼마나 집중해서 봤는지 알 수 있네요
the best there ever was. i'm afraid we will never see another figure skater quite like yuna. with textbook technique and absolutely stunning artistry. truly mesmerizing!
"Nobody, Nobody can jump like Yuna in woman's figure skating. Her speed, Perfect edge, And Lading is amazing. I've watched this sport for a 15Years,  I can sure her technic is superior than any woman."
it’s sad that figure skating lost its art form. all the new figure skaters do is jump to get points but yuna was the whole package. the standard
Who is not Korean and still thinks Yuna is the best female skater in history? 🙋‍♀️
"In 2023, I still come to watch Yuna Queen's videos. She is a legend."
"피지컬, 비율, 테크닉, 표현력, 예술성 이 모든게 완벽한 선수를 아직까지 못 봤다.. 김연아는 진짜 레전드"
I’m Russian and she is mine Sochi champion.
"150.06 has been the world record score since 25th February, 2010, exactly 6 years today! Perfect in every single way. 
Thank you, Queen Yuna!"
"No matter how much this sport evolved, even others have already produced the quads, no one can beat this girl. She has all the elements. Everything that this sport requires. Her connection with the audience is just incomparable."
I grew up in Vancouver and the 2010 Olympics are some of my best childhood memories. But I distinctly remember watching Yuna Kim’s free skate on TV in my mothers bedroom thinking it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. A true Queen.
저 큰 올림픽 두번의 대회를 올클린을 했다는게 정신력이 정말ㄷㄷㄷ
She was born to make history....
"She is the best..the best if all, no question. Her elegance is next level."
"Ten years later, I still come to this incredible performance. She made history and changed this sport forever. I recall I couldn't watch her live, because I was terrified she would miss something and lose her gold medal. No one since then made me feel so involved."
Wow - a ballerina on ice. She dances on the ice with such grace.
"Textbook jumps, while being so artistically graceful, no wonder she's anointed as GOAT in Sports Illustrated. No pre- or under-rotations, flutz, or incorrect jump techniques for her, and CLEAN with No Drugs. She's delivered CLEAN Programs in All her 2 consecutives Olympics programs."
"such an amazing skater. technique, artistic, elegant, literally the definition of a well rounded skater."
Canadians make the best crowd. I just love their sportsmanship.
"2010 Yuna Kim🥇🇰🇷
2014 Yuna Kim🥇🇰🇷


Queen!  ISU & Olympics, please apologize to Yuna. It's time to be grown up!"
"After watching the mess in Beijing, I needed to watch this clip again. Gotta say, this is the best figure skating performance in history, period. She's the perfect combination of athleticism, artistry, grace, beauty, coquettishness. Even her facial expressions are perfectly in tune with the music and the skating. I wasn't sure if I was watching a skater, an actress, a ballerina or all of the above. This performance just can't be topped. Katarina Witt comes in second, and yes the Russian girls jump and spin faster now but they seem like spinning robots."
Still watching Queen Yuna in 2024
"every winter olympics, i come here to relive this beautiful moment in history"
Always come back to watch her beautiful performances each Winter Olympics
"It's a tradition for me to come back here from time to time especially when there's a winter olympic taking place. This performance is textbook perfect. You simply can't compare her to nowadays' ladies skaters. Very beautiful, classy, and yes it's actually hard but she made it looks so easy. Long live the queen."
해설없이보니까 연기에 더 집중하게되고 김연아가 얼마나 대단한 연기를 펼쳤는지 새삼 다시 확인하게되네..... 진짜 길이길이 남을 레전드 선수.... 저 경기를 실시간으로 볼수있었다는게 진짜 행운이었어요
외국인들이 소치 화내주고 김연아가 진정한 챔피언이라고 하니까 내가 다 자랑스럽고 뿌듯함😍😭 연느 짱💖💖💖
"There are no words than can make this performance justice. She is truly a legend, she always proved the real champion she is. All the pressure she had, how can she was able to be so perfect in both artisty and technical content so many times, its just outstanding, really unbeliavable. THIS is a real gold medal performance, her rutine in sochi was worth gold too and I'm happy that the mayority of the world knows it. Forever she will be the real queen of figure skating in the books and in people's hearts."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the golden standard."
"GOAT!!
I found no one better than her. She deserved it. We can't imagine how hard she worked till the end. Thank her for all of her performances sincerely. Best wishes to her!!"
"in a time where every skater uses the same goddamn music, gershwin is such a breathe of fresh air, i adore her music selection"
i have no knowledge of figure skating but they way she moved was so effortless and graceful she looks so magical and breathtaking wow. especially when she jumped respect. i actually teared up watching her performance.
She's like walking poem.
"Ive never been interested in figure skating, nor have any idea on its history.
But what i just watched was so beautiful and graceful, like poetry in motion.
Wow"
"우리의 여왕 
미디어의 발전이 참으로 감사하네요. 언제든 내가 보고 싶을때 이 아름다움을 다시 볼 수 있으니.. 당신은 영원한 대한민국의 여왕입니다. 정말 감사했고 지금도 너무 감사해요."
I love the way she glides as if shes doing a ballet
A TRUE LEGEND.
That’s the most beautiful effortless iceskating I’ve ever seen!
"Kim Yuna will always be the epitome of an ice skating queen for me. Such poise, such grace, absolutely ethereal Yuna!"
So graceful. She is like a ballet dancer on ice. Still bitter about what happened to her in Sochi.
"i'm not even korean, but i really proud of her, kim yuna you're amazing"
"Yuna Kim may not have Quad jumps but her performance is on another level
Her jumps are so soft
It felt like she was cotton every time she lands 
Unlike other skaters it felt like every time they landed on their jumps it was like a ROCK felt on the ice"
지금도 연아의 모습을보면 눈물이 납니다.....우리 대한의 위대한 인간문화제 이자 역사에 길이길이 남을 주인공 연아를 사랑합니다...!
"It's Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics at the moment. Yet, I'm Watching this in Youtube."
"I remember watching this on TV live as a kid. Absolutely beautiful, stunning. Kim Yuna will always be the queen of figure skating"
She is incredible. I've never seen a more graceful skater than Yuna. Her jumps are textbook. She will always be the Queen of figure skating. Long live the queen!
Still my favorite. Her jumps are incredible  and her musicality is untouchable.
"We have many champions, but for me, Yuna Kim is most special. She is real queen, she is art!"
"No amount of quad jumps will compare to the grace, elegance and poise of the lovely Yuna Kim"
"Although 15 years have passed since 2010 Olympics, my eyes are in tears whenever I see this program. It gives me relief, delight, heartwarmth….. just beauty! Just masterpiece."
몇년이 지나도 몇번을 보아도 감동적이고 아름답다. 동시대에 연아같은 선수를 볼 수있었다는게 얼마나 큰 행운인지..^^
"Her tears at the end. She knew, everyone knew, that was simply perfect."
It's really like figure skating was made for her. She's just pure art.
"She is the greatest performer of women skating , nobody can draw the audiences like she does"
"Edge, jump quality, stability, landing flow, motion of arms, steps, spins, choreography, her face and body line, blue dress...Everything is perfect💙"
"I love this entire performance, but I especially love watching her entire physical expression immediately after completing her routine; she knew she had the gold! Brings me to tears every time..."
"She is the best, and still the best four years after, in Sochi! She was the real Sochi gold medal winner! That Russian girl isn't even as half as technically precise and artistically exhilarating as Yuna. One of the greatest figure skaters of all time! <3"
"She is incredible. Such a full package skater. Her jumping technique is so secure and absolutely textbook, her elegance and every element she does is just perfect. She makes jumps literally out of nothing with very little running edge, something which is extremely difficult and unpacks them insanely. And yes, she was robbed in Sochi!"
Every time they announce “the new best ever figure skater the world has ever seen” I return to this performance and know they are wrong.
TWO TIME GOLD MEDALIST⛸🎖
"OMGGG! She looks like she’s FLYING! Especially in 2:24, when you focus on her, it really looks like she is Flying and it’s so MAGICAL!!"
"The most complete women single skater in history. 

She has everythings , big jumps , great speed ,  best dancer , delicate interpretation , tough performer"
"This routine still gives me goosebumps. So graceful and technically sound. Along with her playfulness, expressions, and music. This should be the standard."
"People might beat her technically now or in the future. But ice skating is more than technique. Yuna has a grace, and elegance that is hard to come by. She made it look effortless. I believe she is a once in a lifetime skater. I haven't seen another that has all the characteristics that she possesses on the ice. All while remaining humble. Not many like her."
2018 and still watching this.
"The legend, the real champion! More than 10 years later, I still remember and miss yuna kim. love you so much, Queen!"
Anonymous 2020: Yuna Kim was robbed at Sochi.
"It's 2020 and I still haven't seen a skater with her speed, elegance, musicality, and technical precision and height in their jumps better than Yuna Kim. Hence the reason I keep coming back to watch Kim's old performances to get my figure skating fix."
The most elegantly beautiful free skating in history. Period.
Queen Yuna has donated five billion won so far. No one can replace her!!
"김연아 연기에는 음악과 조화를 이루는 강약조절, 포르테와 피아노가 있고 클라이막스를 표현하는 크레센도 디크레센도 스타카도 테누토 등의 표현이 모두 들어가 있다.  같은 팔 다리 움직임에도 음악에 따라 절도있는 표현과  부드러움 그리고 메트로놈같은 박자연기가 아닌 리타르단도나 아첼로란도 등의 표현을 너무 잘한다.  다른 선수와 분명한 차이점이고 비교될수 없는게 바로 이런표현력차이가 아닐까 싶다.  좀더 예술적으로 보이는 이유도 그래서 인것 같다.  곡선택 역시 다른선수에 비해 탁월한것 같다.  다시봐도 멋지고 아름답다 김연아~"
"Oh seven year old me saw this and was mesmerized. I Remember this so clearly though it was six years ago. Now that i figure skate, she is one of my biggest inspirations. "
This looks straight out of a movie. Truly shows how talented she is.
"She is the whole package. Beauty, artistry, the jumps, choreography, and speed. What a magnificent young woman❤️"
Ugh truly legendary performance. I'm usually critical of over-praising figure skaters but this is absolutely perfect and effortless. The grace. The technique. She has it all.
2019 and still watching. sighs do i miss Queen Yuna :(
Coming back here to appreciate the ice queen's dance. This is what should be the true art and form of figure skating. Not just skating stiffly and doing jumps to get points 🥺
Yuna’s skating dresses are always so gorgeous!!
"With the sport shifting to spamming jumps, you truly recognize and appreciate the art of skating that Kim Yuna embodied.  Jumps are nice but no one keeps me glued to the screen like Yuna."
I applaud her skills. Her costume makes her look stunning. She’s so attractive and classy while doing her smooth moves. Keep it up Yuna Kim!
My heavens she's so beautiful. And still the GOAT. Her skating had magic to it.
"*Hello, it's 2024. Celebrating the great athleticism and artistry of Kim Yu-na, a most complete figure skater and the 2010 and 2014 GOLD medalist and Olympic CHAMPION.*"
"still wondering how someone could have that high level of technicality, musicality and artistry at the same time."
The way she interpret such abstract music is just magical. It's like watching Disney's Fantasia in skating.
"Honestly, she is one of the few Olympic winners that are... memorable and their victory was not a fluke."
"Aside from her skills & expressions, what I like the most about her is the mentality. The burden and the pressure must be so intense but she carried it well. No wonder she's the Queen!"
"I don't know anything about figure skating, but she's the only one that I find elegant and gracious"
This performance right here proves that she is the real queen and the best skater. Sochi wasn't fair and the only reason why that Russian skater won was because that was her own country. Yuna did a wonderful job and everyone knows that she is the real gold medalist.
"Whenever I watch robotic skating with just jumps and music in the background, I come to Yuna for some art on ice."
All podium 👏 She's a true champion. I miss Queen Yuna 💙
She glides and it is like silk . Perfection and so elegant
"She dances on the ice with such power. Most importantly, she doesn't need the Eteri bonus or take banned drugs."
Long Live the Queen Yuna!!!   She is the real Queen on the ice!!!    She is just natural Beauty and Elegance!!!    I miss her bad...
I came here again. still makes me cry.
This made me cried... so beautiful :') perfection
what makes this is so great is i can tell that shes enjoying every single moment she spends on the ice it adds so much to the performance
Who is watching this is 2020  👏🏼
I don't think anyone will beat this level of skating for a while. She is a legend.
She makes skating look as effortless and casual as strolling down the street!
"She skates to the music, and that's a rarity seen in the figure skating."
"진짜 이동영상은 삭제되지않고 많은 사람들이 보았으면한다.
연느님의 올림픽 거쉰 프로그램은 영원히 레전드로 남을듯♥♥"
"True legend and no doubt 2 times olympic champion.
'This is gonna be gold'
'A Performance for The Ages'
'Long live the queen!'
Everyone knows no one can be equal to her."
"Yuna is so graceful, humble, skilled, polite, well-mannered and elegant. I am proud to support her, even though I'm a non-Korean. I fell in love with her ice skating after watching many videos of her. If you're an international fan, comment down how and why you like her!"
와...진짜 몇년전거지만 볼때마다 김연아선수가 우리나라사람이라는게 너무 자랑스러움...♡
still watching in 2022. I don't see many skaters do spirals nowadays. absolute perfection here <3
So far... In history she is the very best female skater!
12 years later still goosebumps
2021년.. 11년이 지난 지금에도 이 경기를 보고 경기를 마친 연아 선수가 울 때 나도 울게 되네요. 이렇게 깊은 감동을 주는 스포츠 경기가 또 있을까요. 2014년 소치 경기는 아직도 분하고 가슴이 아파서 못 돌려봐요😭
"Even in 2021, still haven't found an all rounder skater with exceptional technical execution + artistically pleasing + graceful engaging performance, like yuna kim did in every of her performance back then."
it’s sad that we will never see a program like this ever again
점프후의 연결동작이 너무 예뻐서 백번도 더 본 프로그램♡♡스핀이랑 타노점프는 예술이라능ㅋ우리나라의 보물♡♡너무 예쁘다ㅜㅜㅜ
"She won a gold medal in Vancouver and a platinum one in Sochi!
A living legend and the history will prove it! Long live the QUEEN!"
"This is by far my favorite performance of hers and I cried alongside her in the end- talk about pressure and carrying so much weight on her shoulders from her country, herself, her peers and the world watching her. I can watch her all day"
"彼女のスケーティング技術と表現力が大好きです❤
オリンピックで完璧な演技をできる精神力を尊敬しています😊"
You can really see the power in her revolutions while in the air and but she lands each one so gracefully
"Still watching this after Alina Zagitova's performance yesterday (PyeongChang 2018-23-02, congratulations to her !). In my opinion Yuna is still on another level of performance, with her art bringing a torrent of emotion. New dancers may bring more complex jumps and higher scores, but don't blush Yuna because you're still number 1 in our hearts <3"
"When Yuna skates, it is art!!!"
"Best skater ever in history.  Everything about Kim Yuna and her skating is perfect.  The expressions and even when she gets ready for her jumps it doesn’t show.  All other skaters in the past and even now, when they are about to jump it’s not smooth transition.  This is the best skating program I had ever seen.  Queen Yuna forever!"
She's an epitome of grace and beauty. Everything on points. She is definitely one of the best ice bellarina in history. Period.
"This is not gold. This is DIAMOND.
I'm not ice skating but this sport passionates me and I want to learn it. To  become a champion is my dream, but this Queen is not a champion, she is a LEGEND"
3:54 I love this move here as she reaches out and runs on the ice. There's so much emotion in her gesture and the way it breaks up the flow.
She should have TWO gold medals. She should be a double Olympic champion.
"Even Chinese, Japanese, Russian people are sending love to this Korean skater.
Shows how AWESOME she is"
The most beautiful skater of all time! Even 11 years later. .. watching her effortlessly floating on ice in grace!
"After watching men and women in Worlds figure skating 2019, I'm still stunned by this performance. Her speed alone is supernaturally good, her edges are stronger then most mens, her technique is perfect to near perfect. Her artistry, grace, and ballet like fluidity in perfect timing to the music is beyond compare combined with her out of this world speed and jump technique. Today's skaters can not yet compare to the world class love, grace and hope she embodied for her nation and the world!"
Still watching in 2024! Queen Yuna 💛
The way she skated was an art of her own. She looked like she performed dance on the floor.
"perfect! and so moving...love from japan. thank you, Yuna"
That final spin was perfect to the music. It looked/sounded as if her foot was hitting the drum.
"15년째 보네요.
이 날은 제가 삼성전자 근무 마지막 날인
2010년 2월 26일 금요일.
신변 정리를 하던중 들려온 만세 소리에 깜짝 놀라 고개를 들어보니,
김연아 선수가 프리스케이팅에서 세계최고기록으로 우승하던 순간이었고
많은 동료 직원들의 함성 소리 였습니다.
제 평생 잊지못할 추억으로 남았습니다.
제가 너무도 흐뭇한 마음으로 마지막 정리를 하고 회사를 나왔던 바로 그 날이었습니다.😂

피겨 스케이팅 역사상 가장 위대한 선수로 기억될 김연아 선수. 😂🎉❤"
This will remain one of the best performance by a figure skater in history
쫌전에  베이징 올림픽 피겨 경기보고 김연아무대가 너무 그리워서 보러 왔어요  역시 레전드~~
"I continue watching Yuna's performance whenever I feel tired and depressive. Even now in Aug. 14, 2020"
No one beats her at gracefulness and elegance. She moves like water.
2:22 My favorite part of this program. Stunning without high point skills and dazzlingly graceful with her confidence
One of the glorious moments of Olympic history
She's the most graceful figure skater I've ever seen wow
I've never seen any skater have jumps and transitions this clean. Smooth like butter.
Her step sequence - Wow. She kept the fluidity all throughout this program. And her style of finesse is nothing short of inspirational. Her moves are polished and refined which is so nice to see. Many skaters are great technically but usually lack the artistry. She has both.
"Watching this in Feb 2022 and miss this Olympic game so much. Beijing Olympic is the worst in history and there's no more Olympic spirit 😢.  Yuna Kim's triple jump, height and distance, are higher than most female quad jump in current generation. Simply amazing!"
I refuse to believe this was 11 years ago
"Her interpretation of the music is so perfect.  No other skaters can nor will be able to top Kim Yuna, in the way she effortlessly jumps and expressions of music.  And her smooth transitions into and out of jumps.  This performance I can keep watching it over and over again."
Honestly? I’m watching this in 2018 and she is still a legend.
There will never be another figure skater like Queen Yuna♡
True olympics champion without drugs !
金妍儿的滑行、跳跃都很完美，不论从技术方面还是艺术表现力都是无可挑剔的，真正的女王❤她退役那么多年了，节目依旧百看不厌，永恒的经典😊
Eight years have passed...this still gives me goosebumps every.single.time.
"We all know, no one can ever replace or take her throne. There's a lot of people comparing Yuna and some other skaters from this generation. Yuna already told the media that there's no point of comparing her and other skaters who are competing in Pyeongchang since she is from a different generation. Her PCS was always so low, her scores were underscored, she was destined to suffer because of the careless Korean national skating union and other greedy countries. But the queen managed to become the legend, the idol for everyone in the world and stood up for her country who wasn't even supporting her when it was difficult for her. Now there's skaters getting 80s in short and over 150 in free. There's people saying Yuna would've lost if she competed in Pyeongchang. Though everyone knows that she is a great skater who comes out once in a century. We might not be able to meet someone like her before we die. I miss you so much, and I hope you can rest well after the 2018 Olympics. You did well. You did so much for the nation even after retiring.😊💞"
This program has one of the most beautiful step sequences I have ever seen. She makes it look effortless.
She recently just got married. Congrats our Queen!❤
한치의 망설임도 없이 연기하는 모습이 적어도 이 프로그램만 만번은 연습했을거란 생각이 드네 어쩜 시원시원하게 연기하는 모습이 달인이다 진짜
Every time I watch this I got goosebumps
Came back here again after the doping scandal by russians. This brings me to tears evertime i watch it
"We miss figure skating in those days that we will never see again. The moment yuna act according to the melody of the Gersheen is amazing as if you are dancing in the waves. I can't help but wipe my tears watching this😭

Yuna’s skating is the state of art and the completion of technology. Although it has been more than 12 years, it is as modern and phenomenal as today's game.

Thank you so much, Queen Yuna, for giving us so much courage and comfort❤ And We will be impressed to see it again countless times in the future🙏🏻"
10년 지난 지금도 울컥해.
"She is amazing, after I watched many performances of her, I believe she truly loves her job. She absolutely practiced and trained very hard to achieve where she is now. That’s incredibly beautiful and admirable."
세계 피겨의 질을 확 높여 준 장본인. 역사에 기리남을... 연아가 있었기에 지금이 있다...
"Brings me to tears every time..She is the greatest figure skater of all time. her elegance and every element she does is just perfect. She is real Queen on the ice!  Still here in 2023 and for all the years to come, love you forever Queen Yuna 👑"
2021 and this is still unbeatable. I miss her
"I binged figure skating performances here on youtube but this performance is exceptional and it made me cry!!! this is not sport, this is art!!"
Still the best even after 12 years
Just incredible. Best skater ever in history. In 2023... Yuna still amazes me! She will always be the Queen of figure skating ⛸️ Long live the Queen!!
Wow. She's amazing. I have seen others perform but only Yuna Kim can do it with class and queenly grace.
다시봐도 진짜 깔끔하게 잘한다 어릴때라 그런가 벤쿠버올림픽 때는 패기넘치고 소치올림픽프로그램은 성숙함
She just made it all look so easy even though it was definitely not. No female skater has jumped as beautifully as she.
I just watched this for the first time in years. I’d forgotten how amazing it was.
"After discovering Yuna I have to say this.  

She literally is God's gift to mankind."
flawless performance. She is incredible. Best skater ever in history! QUEEN YUNA 👑
She is all time legend
지금 봐도 대단하네요. 정말 파랑새  한 마리가 얼음 위를 나는 것 같은 모습입니다. 너무너무 멋진 작품이에요.
"first and last REAL ""QUEEN"" of figure skating, literally."
I came here after this freaking Beijing 2022 scandal exploded to see the real olympian and the true champion.
Two time olympic champion💜
"her big jumps, speed across the ice, and artistic steps. She is a truly legend."
우리 연아 진짜 대단하다 장하다 장해 최고다 수백번을 봐도 그냥 짜릿
How does this only have 7.5m views?? This was like the most legendary performance ever
"2010, 2014 Winter Olympic champion Queen Yuna"
Yuna Kim’s skating never fails to move me to tears no lie
She is so humble and yet so powerful!!! 💖
Anyone watching this in 2024? 🫶🏽
"it was a memorable day for me, because of early 2010 i was having a heavy breathing illness that i felt like no energy in myself to breath that night and was about to faint. so my mom and sister took me to my uncle's house that night to rest, while there I sat on the floor and the TV that night was live for the olympics and i saw her winning that night, what a beautiful lady! to this day, i still get those feeling being free of illness and achieve goals in lives 11 years later, men i was 19 . now 30 years old, feeling the best , just a late night tour on line and thought about the past time.."
She is the only skater that deserves this record.
Yuna Kim is a legend like no other. Such an incredible athlete with such ease and artistry. I'll always cherish her performances.
"She literally gives me goosebumps everytime i watch this like, HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?!!!"
Two-times Olympic champion! True Champion! Real Queen! Only One! ★QueenYuna★
유퀴즈 보고 프로그램 다시 순회하는데 피겨역사상 가장 완벽하고 가슴을 뛰게 만드는 전무후무한 프로그램이다 수백번을 봐도 미친 프로그램이야
The most beautiful piece of performance art I have ever seen. Watch those arms! The jumps may be spectacular but although the legs do the work it's the arms that express the artistry. Her musical gestures and timings are impeccable. Never fails to make me cry.
"I have never seen a figure skater as good as her. She's just special. I don't know much about the sport but I watch figure skating every Olympics and never have I been more mesmerized by a performance in the ice rink than Yuna Kim's. Can't exactly pin point on it but she moves with a level of grace and flow that just makes her different from everyone else. Others may be more flexible or they may have a more technical routine or whatever, but they all have something missing in comparison to Yuna. She reminds me of Jet Li who was also a prodigy in Wushu - what one would call a once in century talent."
"The best. Absolutely the best. I’m glad they include the reaction to the score. Her best score before that was 133, 134. The way she obliterated that ... it took years for anyone else to come close to any of the scores she put up in Vancouver. So far ahead of the field. She’d been steadily raising her short program score all season so that wasn’t so much a surprise but 150 for the free was an absolutely massive score that was unthinkable to achieve, and she does it in the most important performance of her life. 150. Insane. That was in range of what the top men were scoring for free skates at the time— high 150’s, and 160’s. Her total score would have put her in the top ten for the men. Legend."
"キム・ヨナさんの、表現力や表情
本当に魅了しますよね✨"
Yuna is much more different than today's robot-like skaters. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!
"Yu-Na doesn't show off herself and has humble personality. After retirement, she rarely does media activities, So sometimes I miss her so much."
"나는 여기서 스파이럴 부분이 그렇게 좋더라 ㅜㅜ
음악구성이랑 딱 맞아 떨어지면서 우아하고 청초해..."
She had complete smooth elegant perfection in every routine I ever saw her in.
she is two times Olympic champion
This is the most overwhelming performance in olympic figure skating history. It is honor to see this program and live contemporarily with the QUEEN. THANK YOU YUNA.
"Happy birthday, Yuna! It's September 5th! <3 Thank you for being born into this earth and bringing lots of delight, inspiration, tears, and joy to many people through your performance. You are the Queen forever in our hearts."
The beauty of this athlete. She's so elegant and charming when she skate
Still watching her performance now even she retired already been 7 years. Yuna will remain as a queen of Figure skating. She is just perfect for every single part on the ice!!!!
"At least for me, she is the most beautiful woman Ive ever seen.. its just awesome, gorgeous, incredible and perfect"
Who's still watching in 2023? ❤
Yuna will be missed forever. She perfectly showed what is figure skating and how figure skating should look like! Smooth skating skills and accurate and consistent jumps. GOAT!
Dude when she cried at the end i cry a little bit too. It's just beautiful and heart-warming how she managed all moves
I just want a moment to talk about her costume. Costumes add a lot to a performance and this one is stunning.
"When you watch her... you can't help but to think... to have this thought approach you in your heart... ""Is this how figure skating should be? This is how figure skating should be...""

Such an effortless quality about her... what an athlete!"
Still one of the greatest figure skating performances of all time. This girl is fully connected with the music. And she is PERFORMING not just cranking out quads. I’m not saying the Russian girls aren’t musical or artistic but when you’re trying to flip 4 times in the air you sacrifice in other areas. FANTASTIC music choice too.
Still can’t get over the daylight robbery that was Sochi. She is still so breathtaking.
This is literally the most beautiful sport ever and I can't get over this performance ahhh I love it so much
"When I saw her crying in the end, I cried too... What a dreamy performance"
Yuna and Yuzuru are the only ones who keep reminding me how artistic figure skating is supposed to be.
"이거 볼 당시엔 몰랐는데,  요즘 나오는 선수들하고 비교해보니 역체감 오짐 ㄷㄷ  너무 당연한게 해서 당연한 건줄"
Here to cleanse my soul from the 2022 Beijing women’s FS
It's always nice to relive the queen's amazing performance.This is real gold.
Still makes me cry. She is a legend . Queen Yuna 👑
ㅠㅠ봐도봐도 안질려..미쳤어 교과서다
Yuna Kim deserves more than a gold and standing ovation! She is incredibly and fearfully amazing!!!  She is truly a legend.
Absolutely flawless. Had me in tears.
"I’ve never get emotional watching performances like these, Yuna is the only exception 😭"
의상 진짜 존~나 세련됨자체다 진짜!!! 11년이 지났는데 너무 심하게 예쁘고 세련됐음 전세계에서 젤!! 역시 대한민국 패션!!
This is the best ever in  history of women's figure skating.  Unforgettable. Im not tired of watching this. Perfect!
"Many times I watched this, I still cried. The art she showed is undeniably speechless."
honestly can't be any better than this. what a legend performance
The best program and performance in history. Stunning.
"her score will be broken one day b/c things change over time, scoring system will change over time, rules will change over time. not just figure skating, but many other sports too. it's been 6 years and the fact that she still hold the record is just amazing. however, the perfection yuna has will never be beaten. she's the one and only queen of figure skating who has both artistic and technical excellence."
My dad loved this Gershwin music and was a great sports fan. I wish he could have lived to see her performance.
can i watch the performance like this again in my life? her performances were glorious🌟
Whenever I want to remind myself what passion and athleticism looks like I go back to this video. It never fails to make me tear up. Yuna is amazing.
She was like a blue fairy sprinkling her magic.
"I like it when watching figure skating and the performers actually look like they're moving to the music. So many performances I've seen, the skating was good, the music was good, butt the movement of the performer and the rhythm of the music didn't match up."
She looks ABSOLUTELY beautiful! Yuna is my forever hero. Her skating touched me a lot. Thank you Yuna!
"벌써 10년이 지나서 이젠 국뽕 다 빼고 연기로 감상했는데,
너무 아름답다."
"At that time, I thought that this glorious performance score would not be broken......but nowaday the score is inflated since sochi olympic. but I believe that she is QUEEN and live FOREVER"
She’s the queen no one can change my mind
"誰がなんと言おうとこの大会あの優勝はこの人だった
練習拠点がカナダってのもピークを合わせるのに力になったのはあるだろうけど、自分の戦い方を見つけてルールを最大限活かして積み重ねて磨いてきた、だから本当に強かった。紛れもない天才。"
레전드 명불허전 정말 피겨계의 레전드다
"Forever a legend, a queen, Yuna Kim"
팔.다리가 길쭉 길쭉하니... 무용수 같은 몸.. 그 피지컬로...피겨를 해... 완전 타고난 사람임.
14년전 프로그램인데 어찌 지금봐도 의상이며 안무며 전혀 촌스럽지않고 우아하고 세련될수있을까ㅠㅠ 그립네요 연아선수❤️
"Мәнерлеп сырғанау тарихы жоқ елден шығып, талай ауыр жарақат пен қиындықтарды басынан өткеріп, жетістіктің ең биік шыңына шығу - нағыз ерлік! Нағыз аңыз адам - Ён А!"
Legend
She is the legend.
Wonderful lady. Poetry in motion. So smooth and graceful. And all done with a humility which is astonishing given the fact she was operating on a different league to any other skater. Her reaction when she gets the score is beautiful. Queen of Korea and Queen of ice skating.
10년전인데 촌스러움이 1도 없네 ㄷ ㄷ 엊그제 대회 치른 느낌;!!
"내가  평생 본 모든 피겨 중 제일 완벽함 
피겨의 정석"
I feel blessed with the amount of Kim Yuna videos <3
"연아의  눈물........
감동적이네...
수고했어......금메달 리스트.
가장  우아하고  세련된   프로그램같아...
몸도  마음도 아름다운  연아....."
still watching this in 2020
True Sochi Olympic Champion! Two Time Olympic Champion!! Queen YUNA !
"How can she dance so gracefully yet sooo clean😍😱 she looks like a ballerina with skates on 😍😍😍 also full of emotions, you can really see the passion wooowwwww annyeong unni👋😍"
"10-22-22 
the woman we see in this video who helped and inspired many people by her wonderful personality and unparalleled skating career was now married to her husband whom she met at her All That Skate ice show in South Korea 🎀

Long live the Queen!"
I don't know why she still doesn't have her own country I just wanna be her subject 😍 LONG LIVE THE QUEEN😙
이보다 더 아름다운 표현을 할 수 있는 스케이터가 나올 수 있을까..
언제까지나 가장 경이로운 피겨의 여왕으로 우리 안에 남아 있을 겁니다. 김연아 선수 정말 자랑스럽고 고맙습니다.
"I don't care if the Russians have taken over, I've been coming back to this for years because Yuna is the true queen"
"Комментарийлерді оқып отырсам, ол кездері конькидің салмағы қазіргіден ауыр болған дейді, бірақ, таңқаларлығы - Ёна жеп-жеңіл секірген ғой! Дәл бір қауырсын сияқты! Патшайым! 💙"
"after her crying, I found I'm also crying!!!"
She is still the best!
MY two time olympic gold medalist 💪🏽
"To this day, no one skates as perfect as her."
A true skater in a drug-free era
저때 유나킴 울 때 전국민 다 같이 울었다
Yuna Kim you will always be famous…. Genuinely one of the most graceful and effortless athletes we’ve ever seen on the ice she’s such a gift
"NO WORDS, SHE'S INCREDIBLE, AMAZING AND UNBELIEVABLE, WOW JUST WOW!"
Anyone in 2021?
True Sochi Olympic Champion! Two Time Olympic Champion!! Queen YUNA !
"Performance of the ages
She skate with incredible speed into her jumps , textbook qualities , fluid movements , feel the music"
"I think Yuna Kim may have been the last of the great figure skaters to beautifully balance the athletic component of jumps and the traditional aesthetics, artistry and musicality which previous skaters have embodied. I mean we all love watching clean triple and quad combo jumps but there comes a point where the artistry just dies and ceases to exist. I don’t know how the IOC and other organisations plan to remedy this loss of artistry. I miss the artistry exhibited by Yuna Kim and the likes of other greats like Michelle Kwan etc."
"WOW, QUEEN YUNA she shines like diamonds from the beginning to the end."
"Замечательное катание. 
Чуткая душа. 
Божественно. 
Хочется еще смотреть"
im still crying watching her performance 😭
The elegance omg I love her
2020 still watching. Her skating is not a sport. It’s more like art. Not a single skater got me goosebumps but Yuna. I miss watching her graceful skating so much... she is an ‘arthelete’. 😂
Yuna kim is the queen 👑
"All of us, skating lovers, miss Yuna...

Fantastic simply fantastic"
"Miss you, Queen Yuna"
The best performance ever
Russia sochi stoled her gold
She's still the queen. 👑
Thanks for a great show
I wish that she could be the last runner of the torch for PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games 2018.
언제봐도 이작품은 명작임
Gosh i love this woman i have no words she is art and she creates poetry. She makes you feel something! Hearing her life story too. Long live the queen 👸 forever the best female figure skater
She was robbed in Sochi
She really is a near flawless skater
Yuna... I miss your artistry and ur musicality... today's figure skating (jump skating) gives me such a eyesores.
Absolutely the best era of women's figure skating ever
"My queen ♡♡ I LOVE YOU YUNA ♡♡ 
Two time Olympic champion and a legend ♡♡"
STILL THE QUEEN!!!
Still the best.
Her jumps are Textbook!! Forever Queen 👑
This is really the height of Figure Skating and I’m so angry how Russians destroyed the credibility of this sport.
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS RECORD IS NOW BROKEN..
Who’s watching the queen in 2024?
2024년 난 또 이영상을 보고있네요 ㅎㅎ   내년에도 10년후에도 또 보고 있겠지요 ❤❤❤❤😂
"Прекрасная  программа, исполненная на высочайшем уровне, ее катание завораживает, и сложность, и красота."
She is an inspiration ❤
Still the best female figure skater for me 💖
"何度も見に来てしまう
本当に素晴らしい
ルッツトゥが極上"
"아무리 다시 봐도 너무 아름답고 감동적이다. 
최고의 피겨 경기 아니 공연이다. ❤️"
굳이굳이 여기 댓글창 와서 김연아 경기 폄하하는 사람들이 아직도 있다는게 웃기네. 멋지고 아름다운 경기를 그대로 보고 받아들이질 못하고 질투하고 썽내는게 너무 불쌍함 .
"Wow, such a beautiful performance."
"Finesse, grace, elegance and technicality, this amazing skater had it all."
2020 and still mad about Sochi
"2018, still LEGEND."
This is the Figure Skate.
"2023 and still watching this amazing performance ❤.
For me, there's no one like Queen Kim Yuna and King Yuzuru Hanyu.."
이런 선수가 다시 나올 수 있을까? 내 생애에서만큼은 다시 못 나올 듯...
"Yes this is right. Sochi was ""wrong"""
"watching 2020?, With 10Y anniversary"
Absolutely amazing performance again. She's so flawless. Perfect performance! She's the best skater in the world history.
"실수없이 완벽한 무대도 감동,
넘 자연스런 동작과 고난위기술도 감동,
 끝나고,울먹이는 모습도 감동이네요~!"
The one and only queen!
Best Skater in the World :)
The only fs better than this in Olympic history is her Sochi one. Almost a decade after and she’s still the standard.
"If Sotnikova really won the last winter olympics, why aren't they promoting her video and keep on reposting Yuna's masterpieces? Kind of contradicting since Sotnikova won the latest olympics yet the Olympics Committee reposted this video LOL."
Again THAT DRESS
진짜 피겨 보러 옴
She is my favorite skater! She is the best in skating history. *Queen Yuna* 👑
whos here in 2021?
She is a legend !
She’s an inspiration…❤️❤️❤️
"김연아 선수님 안녕하세요. 오래전 영상이지만 보아도 보아도 감동적입니다. 대한민국의 자랑이며, 세계적인 피겨 스타! 늘 응원하겠습니다."

She made me cry. This was so beautiful :(((
"wow, perfect"
textbook
gorgeous. that is all I can say.
flawless performance. She is incredible. Best skater ever in history! QUEEN YUNA 👑
She got so robbed but that second rate Russian girl...its probably my least favorite Olympics because of that.
I wonder if they ever get dizzy?!
"I remember watching this on tv with my mom at the time and just remembering how she looked like a fairy gliding on ice, she was just so magical and enchanting. I come back to watch this again from time to time bc it brings back that magical nostalgia! 😊"
"After all these years, still one of the most beautiful things I have seen."
She is my favorite skater ❤️ Still the best!
Perfect.... I think we cannot define her performance any definitive things..
"Annyeonghaseo.  2023 still watching, admiring the great talent of Kim Yuna.  Kamsahamnida."
"I see why she is called the queen. Absolute perfection. The way she gracefully launches to perform an axel...,like so effortlessly.. you can never see it coming ❤"
Long live the Queen!! 👑 still makes me cry...😭 She looks so beautiful when she skates. she's a legend. I miss her.❤️

"Epitome of grace, power, speed and resiliance. No one can top her, even after 14 years!"
her little smiles after each spin she Knows what she's doing!!
"i remember watching this in korea as a kid,,, u are the true 2 time gold medalist Yuna"
all time legend
"I am not Korean and I don't figure skate but when she cried, I cried too"
Perfection. She is a true queen on the ice.
"I haven't cried while watching figure skating, except when watching Yuna."
여왕 김연아❤  결혼 진심으로 축하드려요!!!
"The music is so dramatic, but watching her skate to it is so relaxing yet beautifully moving.  I think listening to this musical piece by itself would be a bit too 'disturbing' to have relaxed enjoyment.  Thanks Yuna!"
"Everytime I watch this performance by Yuna Kim, I think of Michelle Kwan. Yuna said Michelle was her idol and I feel like Michelle won through Yuna."
This beautiful Olympic champion queen is getting married in October! congratulations!!
"Some hard-working talented athletes make their work as a piece of art, and I think kim yuna is one of them."
"13 years ago she made history, there are no skater like her anymore"
"After this olypics, Especially in women figure skating it is dirt with drug and unfair judegements. She is the real queen and the last olypics I can watch with gratitude"
"I am watching in 2024 😊 🌟❤️🌹⛸️⛸️🌹❤️🌟
Kim YUNA is a Beautiful Ice Skater ❤️‍🔥⛸️⛸️❤️‍🔥🌟"
Represent! That was extraordinary Kim Yuna. I'm watching this st the height of summer in Michigan. What a treat.
A skater once said that when you land a triple jump it feels like you're crashing out of a rollercoaster. I hadn't known that because Yuna literally makes it look so effortless.
"감동 그자체다
 연아님 같은 시대를 함께 해줘서 참 감사합니다"
"ステップや、難しい姿勢からすぐにジャンプを跳んでいるのに、演技が途切れない。
ほんと凄いなぁ。
そしてヨナは衣装も綺麗。
ヴァンパイアの衣装が一番好き。"
김연아  눈물  한방 울에 대한민국  국민들의 눈시울이  울컥  가슴이  뭉쿨  햊ㅣㅂ니다  세계의 영원한  챔피언  김연아 👍👍👍
the only ice figure skater who skates like a falling feather and a swan
"-one of the best figure skaters’-
The one and only best figure skater. Ever."
Watching yuna kim finish this is always inspirational
完璧なジャンプと演技、、、優雅で魅力的((＊´꒳`＊))この時代の選手たちのスケートはスポーツというよりも芸術って感じがするから見ごたえがあって好き((＊´꒳`＊))
김연아의 경기를 볼때마다 너무 감동이 되어 눈물이 납니다 정말 대단합니다 평생   잊지 못할겁니다 너무 자랑스럽습니다!
"Everytime the life gives me a lemon, I watch this."
2024. 5.27 👏 I came here again. Yuna still amazes me! I miss her👑
"Already This is 12years ago...
Still We miss this time."
20년동안 벤쿠버 하나보고 달려왔는데 이렇게 완벽하게 끝내서 얼마나 시원하고 후련할까
"I thought it be awhile before we see another female skater of this caliber ....It's been very 14 years , and we're still waiting"
She is one of my favourite skaters ❤️
Who’s still watching in 2024 🫶🏻🫶🏻 queen Yuna will always remain in our hearts ❤️
Absolutely an angel from heaven on ice/ perfect in every way snd form/ even at Sochi too
"That record stood for 7 years and if judging was scored correctly today, this still should have stood as the current record."
"The jumps are so accurate. Mesmerizing technique. I absolutely love her salcow, apart the textbook lutz."
She is just so beautiful seeing her perform makes me so emotional
I never cried watching someone skating. She made me cried for doing such a beautiful artistic performance like this . I don’t care about people being able to rob point through giving fake landings and quads but none of the skaters these days can beat the kind of art this girl can put into her master piece (I am only clinging into yuzuru hanyu and nathan now even though I personally prefer yuna’s performance but him and nathan at least are genuinely unforgettable and magnificent unlike those skaters who literally has no sense of art.
Wow she is like a swan. So beautiful and graceful.
who else burst into tears with her when she finished?!! her routine was so beautifully moving ❤️❤️
"視聴数が1000万回を超えましたね
とても嬉しいです
バンクーバーから12年経っても世界の皆さんからのコメントがキムヨナさんの演技の素晴らしさを改めて教えてくれます"
何かを知れば見え方がガラリと変わるんですね、音の聞こえ方さえ。思い出せないほど時が経ってしまってもこの演技が残っているのは有り難い。
"久しぶりに観ました。
当時から私はキムヨナの演技が1番好きだった。
やっぱり、今でも1番好き😊"
"Did she come from heaven or what?
Definitely this angel’s performance
Wants me to be a better artist ( I paint)
and a better person. Ethereal !"
어후 14 년 지나고 보는데도 왜케 심장이아프냐 긴장을 늦출수가 업네..
"This was so satisfying, heartwarming, and aesthetically pleasing to watch. It is like she owns the ice ring and is one with it<3"" Turly magnificent❤"
SHE HAD ME CRYING SHE SLAYYED THST RANK❤😢🎉
연아는 스포츠라 했지만 얼음 갈리는 소리조차 예술로 들림. 슥슥 가서 점프 뛰는것도 너무 멋있고 다시 봐도 멋있다…. 이때 직관한 사람들 너무 부럽다…
"이젠 추억으로만 기억할수있다니 너무 슬픔
그시절 두근거림은 어데로가고   .......
참  행복한 시절이이었어."
単にジャンプが良いだけではなく、全てのジャンプがプログラムの中で完璧に前後の演技を繋げ表現力も相俟ってプログラムを完成させている。間違いなく現役選手達のお手本なのです🩷
Long live the Queen ❄️ I miss Queen Yuna.
2024년에봐도 말을 잃게 만드는 엄청난 점프 퀄리티.. 스케이터로써 갖춰야할 모든것을 갖춘 올타임레전드 스케이터⭐️
yuna still amaze me. I miss her!
김연아의 영향력은 정말 전세계적으로 대단하구나 12년전인데 얼마 안된댓글이 많네
Watching in 2024... She is amazing! Queen 👑
"So fluid, swift, elegant and beautiful. Flawless. ✨"
I miss her so much...
"i don't know anything about figure skating, but it makes me cry"
"She is Amazing,,Watching in 2024😊😊😊"
"She never got off the podium, queen of ice skating!"
"I came to watch this again after that beijing mess
She is a true champion🤍"
"She’s just so amazing and graceful, her skating is just breathtaking. I still can’t understand till this day how can people say that Russian girls are the best skaters of all time, like yes they are absolutely gorgeous and talented but never in a million years will someone have better technique, jumps and transitions than Yuna."
"지금도 그때의 감동이 그대로
전해집니다 정말 아름다움의 극치입니다 ❤❤  김연아보유국
대한민국 만세입니다"
"My super hero ❤
Its my birthday today and I'm hating it but watching yuna makes me feel better."
she has a way of making the ice look soft and forgiving. what a legend
저 시대는 진짜 탑급선수 말고는 200점 못넘었던 시댄데 228점... 진짜 인류를 초월한다. 지금은 개나소나 200 넘고 도핑에 점수 후려치고 러시아만 개 퍼줘서 250 가까이도  받지만ㅠ 연아선수에게  유일하게 편파판정없이 점수 제대로 준 경기인듯
회사에서 일하다가 생방 나올때 다들 일멈추고 숨죽이고 봤음 ㅡㅡ 이게 벌써 14년전이라니....이때 퀸연아 덕분에 사장님 눈물 흘리는거 첨봤음 ㅋㅋㅋ 그래도 여러시즌 다들  연아퀸덕분에 행복했음
The Last Olympic Champion of Women Skating.
"역시 연느님을 보유한 대한민국이 자랑스럽고, 연느님 올림픽 피겨영상 보면 스트레스 해소가 되는 것 같네요. ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ"
"2024 this is the very first time I watched it 😱 OMG she is talented and amazing. I’m speechless. I just know she is very popular in fashion industry, but I don’t event knew How amazing she was🎉"
So powerful! She is a legend. Queen 👏
Yuna kim… she is my inspiration
빙판위에서 추는 발레 진심 하나의 부족함 없이 아름답다🎉 지금도 견줄 대상이 없는 퀸연아
"Without a doubt, YU-NA KIM will forever be the Queen of ""Art Skating"", clear movements, without effort, interpreting the music that fills the space. Technical, without a doubt, impeccable, but irrelevant to me, because, from beginning to end, in its presentation, I am being seduced, by this ethereal, beautiful and elegant muse, who keeps everyone stunned.

Actually, today, I don't see art in this sports discipline, as everything is about overcoming turns and more turns, in short, everything is very technical. I think this competition should change its name... to ""Technical Skating"", but nothing about art."
14年も経つのに何度見ても感動する。技術もさる事ながら10代とは思えない表現力が素晴らしい。そう言えば羽生選手や坂本選手が尊敬する選手にキムヨナさんを上げてたのも納得です🌹
"Хоть я и русская, но считаю, что Юна заслуживает 1 место. Её серебро сияет ярче золота!"

오랜만에 떠서 봤는데 마지막 눈물에 그때 당시 기억이 확 되살아나면서 뭉클하고 대견스럽고 그러네ㅠ 5천만의 기대를 한몸에 받고 어깨에 짊어지고 뛰었을 어린 소녀.. 저 순간은 모든면에서 영원히 대체못할 위대한 역사가 되었다고 생각한다
"I miss her and yuzuru, there's no skaters like this anymore"
She is the best skater ever
flawless performance... still the best! Queen <3
Queen yuna! Congratulations!!  I'm so happy for you☺️❤️
그저 신. 10년이 지나도 100년이 지나도 1000년이 지나도. 한국사람이 봐도 미국사람이 봐도 외계인이봐도. 말도안될정도로 미친 수준ㅜㅜㅜ 하나님부처님알라신도 놀랄듯
연아님은 진짜 어나더레벨이다...
Miss her in 2024. love u soooo much Queen👑
"언제나 당당하면서도 세련되고 품격있는 아름다운 모습을 보여주었던 대한민국 모든 국민들이 사랑하고 박수쳤던 국민 여동생  김연아선수 당신은 최고입니다❤
당신때문에 대한민국이 많이 행복했습니다."
Absolutely breathtaking and exquisite. ⛸️💞
"I am watching in March 2024. I Love Forestella and when I saw that Kim YuNa is married to Woorim, I had to watch her Ice Skating. 😊. She is amazing and skates beautifully! She is a Real Champion.
South Korea has so many wonderfully talented people. ⛸️❤️🌹❤️⛸️"
"当時批判していた人たちは本当に彼女の演技を見たことがあるのかな。
どう考えてもこの人が金メダル🥇で間違いないでしょ。
小細工なしの離氷動作と高さのあるジャンプ。
大きな上半身の動きと繊細なスケーティング、演技力。
まさに完璧！！
加点要素しかない。
そしてこの拍手と動画の再生回数、賞賛の海外コメントを見れば批判していた日本人が間違っていたとわかる。
久々に見てつい熱くコメントしてしまったけど、本当に素晴らしい。
そしてオーサーコーチも優秀ですね。
バンクーバーの女王、キムヨナさん🥇✨✨"
So beautiful! Long live the Queen 👑
All time LEGEND🇰🇷🥇
Watching this without any commentators commenting is just MAGICAL! ❤
A once in a lifetime talent
3:37 the greatest moment in figure skating history
Absolutely beautiful
2024년에도 봅니다. 김연아 사랑해요
A true legend! Queen Yuna 👑
My favorite women skating!!! She is like flying on the ice ❤ truly amazing
지금 보아도 감동이네...저런 감동을 언제 다시 느껴볼 수 있을까...내평생에~~
The Last Olympic Champion of Women Skating.
"진짜 훌륭한선수이다  한분야에서  
탑을 찍는다는건 어떤느낌일까
멋지다 아름답다 ❤"
ジャンプの入り出の工夫も凝っているし難しい飛び方しながらもかなり質の高いジャンプを飛んでいる。この時代にジャンプの入り出にここまで工夫を凝らしていたのはキムヨナ選手くらいしかいなかったんじゃないでしょうか？全体的にパワフルでありながら優雅に流れるような演技、クイーンと呼ばれるだけありますね。素晴らしい。
I miss u Yuna..
The way she cries tears of joy at the end
even today her free skate is worth alot
"수십년전부터 피겨선수들 보아왔는데 피겨역사에 최고의 예술성 퀄리티 음악 의상 구성
모든게 완벽한 선수가 김연아 인듯 
스포츠와 예술의 조합 
이런선수는 역대 피겨상 없었고 앞으로도 없음"
너무 완벽해서 앞뒤에 선수들 점프 할라고 발버둥친거 다 기억에도 안 남았던 연기...😢
Last true winner of olympics :)
Queen Yuna forever! 👑
Who's still watching in 2024 because you miss Yuna Kim perform? 🥹
私は年齢を重ね老人になり今この瞬間に彼女の演技を観ても感動することはありません。しかし…2010年にこの演技を目の当たりにした時に受け取った感動を一生忘れることはないでしょう。
"2024. 😊 I am from Colombia, and just knew about for her marriage with Ko Woorim, the bass of Forestella. She's so delicate and they make a beautiful couple. Also, as I see she representes  like our Mariana Pajon ""the BMX' queen"". 😂💖💖💖🇰🇷🪷🪷🪷🌈💯"
그녀는 현존하는 최고의 여자 스케이터 ~~ 사랑하고 항상 응원합니다!!^^
난 저 음악을 뚫고 나오는 얼음 타는 소리가 너무 좋다…..
still makes me cry 🥹
i need people to come back here and learn something about figure skating 🙏
연아는 최고로 멋지다. 저렇게 깔금하고 아름답게 경기를 펼치다니 소름돋는 명연기였다. 피겨스케이팅 레전드 유나퀸
2위랑 40점 차이... 지금 봐도 압도적인 경기🥺💙
she’s surely a QUEEN
"아직까지도 눈물나네.
감동..
자랑스럽고 아름다운 연아
정말 훌륭합니다."
"Ниже написали, что после 2010 она катала без эмоции. Ну не знаю, лично я не могу сказать, сколько раз я плакала, смотря её произвольную программу ""Отверженные"" на чемпионате мира 2013 и короткую программу в Сочи"
"Kim Yu-na, who is different in everything that is not mechanical but only powerful."
"2025년에 봐도 굉장하네요 음악자체네요
세계가인정한 김연아
현재는 안세영 참 대단한 대한민국의 여제다"
"Настоящая чемпионка - Ким Ён А!  Она ни разу в своей карьере не опускалась ниже пьедестала почёта. Она первой собрала все наивысшие титулы. Она била мировые рекорды одиннадцать раз, восемь из которых сама же установила. Она участвовала на двух Олимпиадах и шести чемпионатах мира и всегда была с медалями. На Олимпиадах 🥇 и 🥈, на чемпионатах мира 🥉🥉🥇🥈🥈🥇! Еще на Финалах гран-при 🥇🥇🥈🥇! Она просто лучшая! 👸 Русские девочки гибкие, делают прекрасные ультра-си, связки у них прекрасные"
4:57 부터 뒤쪽에 오서코치 이미 직감하고 박수치고 기뻐하고있음... 연기끝나자마자 환호!! 와 이장면은 정말 몇번을 봐도 울컥하넹😂😂
She did it so smoothly ❤️
"연아 김, ROK! 150 /225.5 points! Mission impossible! 
한마디로 얼음위를 종횡무진으로 달린다. 금메달이 아니라 백금메달 수준이다. 푸른빛의 천사처럼! 정말 자랑스러운 대한민국의 예쁜딸. 만세!🫡🫡🫡"
너무도 완벽하고 아름다운 스케이팅 점프며 안무며 홀리며 수천번보게되는~ 점프는 날라다니는데 거기에 우아해 피겨여왕  갓연아
All time legend.🥇🥇
sooooo beautiful!! Still the best. Long live the Queen🌟
Breathtaking performance is an understatement.
Не перестаю смотреть и восхищаться Юной Ким❤❤❤
Graceful. That's what sticks out to me. Her skating is graceful. Not a weight lifter trying to dance or look graceful. Mean no disrespect to weight lifters.
スケート史上、最高です。何度でも見たい。
"Every time she skates, i end up crying. Its like watching ballet."
Long live the Queen Yuna ♡2024
The essence of modern women's figure skating..Nothing to add or subtract. This program is like a fresh wind in early spring
"I still love her, incredible"
"선수님 진짜 대단하세요! 저도 스케이팅을 배우고 싶었는데 여긴 여름이라(베트남) 배우기가 많이 힘드네요 ㅠㅠ 지금까지 정말 수고 많이 하셨고, 언제까지나 세계에서 가장 멋지고 아름다우신 선수에요! 언제나 행복하세요!(아직도 선수님의 찐팬이에요:)"
I am watching this in 2024
"그때 당시만해도 지면 신문이 활성화 되어있던 시절,  
그녀의 쇼트 프로그램 시뮬레이션을 그림으로 표현 하며 예측 하던 신문기사를 보며 기대 했고
근무시간에 몰래 훔쳐 경기를 훔쳐보던 긴장의 순간을 잊지 못한다.
그녀의 긴장과 패기넘치는 표정 또한 아직도 삶의 귀감이 되고 있어요.
금메달 그 이상의 감동과 희망을 선사 해준 연아 선수에게 감사 드립니다....^^❤"
"정기적으로 보러 와야 하는 영상..
연아퀸..♡"
So graceful! Long live the Queen ❤️
연아 언니 또 왔어
진짜 이 프로그램의 진수는 스텝시퀀스인듯.... 음악에 완전히 동화된듯한 움직임
일부 브라이언 오서 덕분이라는 일본인들 댓글이 참 안타깝다..오서는 그냥 운 좋게 천재 김연아와 하뉴 유즈루를 만나서 유명해진 일개 코치일 뿐임. 왜 두명의 천재 아시아인의 재능을 백인 남성의 공치사로 돌리면서 후려치는지 이해가 되지 않는다…코칭 능력도 중요하겠지만 김연아와 하뉴같은 부류는 본인의 재능과 노력이 대단했던 부류이다
"Started to interesting in ice skating because of her, kim yuna."
언제다시봐도 멋찐 우리김연아~~항상 건강하고~~~즐겁께사시길 ㅎㅎㅎ대한민국이낳은 딸래미~~~~
"너무 완벽하고, 청초하고, 아름다워서 눈물만 흐르네요··· 영원한 우리의 여왕🥲🥲"
"저때가 올림픽 피겨스케이팅의 최전성기 였고, 피크였다. 지금은 점프 팡팡 뛰면서 점수 따는 종목으로 전락해 버렸다. 김연아의 피겨는 완벽하고 정확한 기술, 그리고 형언할 수 없는 감동의 예술성이 완벽하게 조화된 하나의 예술작품이다. 요즘의 피겨스케이팅은 보는 재미도 없고 감동도 없고 흥분도 없다."
Two gold medalist Kim Yuna
Who still watching Aug. 03 2024?  My idol Yuna Kim
Such a beautiful performance.
YUNA KIM ERES LA MEJOR NO EXISTE EL TIEMPO EL ESPACIO O LA DIMENCION ALIENATE Y SINCRONISATE EN TU CORAZON
브라이언 오서 너무 좋아하네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 우는 건 너무 맘이 찡하다.. 어린 나이에 너무 부담됐을 텐데 이겨내줘서 고마운💙 나이 들어보니 알겠어 얼마나 힘들었던 자린지..
who is still watching in 2024！
이 영상을  보니  김연아가  그리워지네요..아직도  이런 스케이터가  없네요..
6:18 coach's words of affirmation are EVERYTHING AWWW
Here i come for the legend❤
Wow!!! She's so awesome  (the best of the best) 김 연 아/ 대한민국 ♡
19 janeiro de 2024 começa às Olimpíadas da Juventude na Coreia do Sul e Yuna Kim continua a ser uma lenda insuperável na patinação do gelo passados 14 anos desta apresentação histórica.
"キム・ヨナ選手最高です✨👍
優勝おめでとうございます😊
世界一のゴールドメダリスト🥇"
"So graceful, miss her!"
I'm watching it in 2024.❤
항상 볼때마다 내가 눈물나옴… 정말 존경스러운 선수다
何度見ても素晴らしい。言葉が出ない
She is still my one and only queen
久しぶりに見ています。真央ちゃんを応援していましたが、キムヨナさんのスケートは完璧でしたね、最後の涙感動しました✨(*^^*)
literal goosebumps everytime
Still my favorite
She is grace itself
Can we just accept the fact that yuna won at sochi even tho she didn't???
👑 Y U N A 👑
Certainly the last controversy-free women’s figure skating Olympic champion.  The last three are drug tainted.
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN 💙💙💙💙💙
何度でも見たくなる素晴らしい演技。
마지막 음악이 끝났을때는 진짜 무슨 여왕같네 와..
She's dancing to the music.
10 years later we still mad
10년도 더 지난 지금 다시 봤지만 너무 너무 멋지다❤❤ 가끔 tv든 유튭이든 나와서 스케이트 타는모습 보여줬으면...
Who is still watching  2024
Best free skate ever ❤

"기술적인 거 다 떠나서,
퀸연아처럼 엄청난 속도로, 빙판을 넓게 쓰는 여자선수는 없다."
Queen Yuna ❤️
이게 세계 1위 선수라는거구나 싶어서 감동 심하다
2024 still watching queen yunaa?
I’ve never seen someone so elegant ❤❤❤
All time legend 👑
"퀸연아의 멋진 경기! 올림픽 챔피언! 밴쿠버올림픽 금메달, 소치올림픽 금메달! 2연속 금메달의 위대한 선수 피겨퀸 유나퀸! 소트니코바는 금메달 자격이 없다. 점수 퍼받고 편파판정이라는 심판들의 승부조작으로 금메달을 목에 건 부끄러운 메달일 뿐이다. 러시아에서 개최된 소치올림픽은 역대 최고의 승부조작 스캔들"
진짜 볼 때마다 울컥하게 되네
노래 딱 끝날때 눈물이 나네요 얼마나 피나는 노력을 했을까
SHE IS THE QUEEN.
Her dress is gorgeous 😩
Who's still watching un 2024😊

Congratulations Yuna!!
❤long live the Queen YUNAAA❤
Poetry in motion ❤
"음악과 하나된 예술 그 자체
아름답다는 말 밖에"
"If a judge doesn't recognize how insane she is, it should be career ending tbh."
I miss her!😢❤
"when I watch her performance, I get to know why this sport is named as ""Figure"" skating."
지금봐도 뭉클❤
A true legend queen yuna

진짜 미학자들이 주장하는 예술만이 도달할 수 있다는 고귀한 정신적인 가치를 나는 평소에 그걸 인정하지도 않았고 그저 세계를 더 선명히 보여주는 사진의 출현으로 인해 정체성에 위협받던 예술이라는 분야의 정체성을 확보하기 위해 주장하는 궤변일 뿐이라고 생각해왔다. 실제 르브르 박물관에서 모나리자를 직관하고 바티칸시티에 가서 천지창조와 최후의 심판을 직접 관람했을 때도 어떠한 예술이 갖는 미적 극치를 느끼지 못했고 그렇기에 어떠한 감동도 느끼지못했다. 하지만 김연아의 피겨연기를 보면서 내가 왜 우는지도 모르는 영문 없는 눈물이 날 때 비로소 이것이 미학자들이 주장하는 예술만이 갖는 미적 극치가 아닌가 생각하게된다
"벌써 2024년의 끝자락이다..
연느와 한시대를 했다는건 지금도 감사해"
LONG LIVE YUNA QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
The GREATEST KIM YUNA✝️❤️
Beautiful…..better than anyone today

Hey Yuna is getting married this year
나는 조지거쉰 이경기가 내 맘속에 베스트 십년 후 2034에도 보고있을듯~ 사랑해~!!! 연아
김연아에게 올림픽보다 더 크고 권위있는 대회가 없다는게 아쉽다 특히 소치올림픽은 정말 이런 선수가 나가기 아까운 대회였다
"She's elegant. The definition of graceful, perfect skater."
Long live the queen

no.1  my  favorite
"I miss this golden era of figure skating. Kim Yuna and Mao Asada are my favorites. They knew how to make performances interesting and dramatic. Now the performances are point-centric and forgettable, and overshadowed by unnecessary drama, which is sad."
💙💜 She is adorable
다른 선수들 최고점이 188? 인데 김연아만 220점이 넘은 거에요? 진짜로 ?? 대박

"I think what I appreciate the most about Yuna’s technical abilities are her speed and the distance that she gets from her lutzes and flips.  I think other than Midori Ito, Yuna’s lutzes and flips are incomparable. However, her edge jumps are definitely a bit suspect (no triple toe loop here) and her layback is really not on par with the rest of her program."
"キムヨナは高麗大学と高麗大学院で体育教育学を専攻しました。
そしてフィギュアスケートコーチの資格を取得して10年になりました。
現役を引退するやいなやすぐ資格証を取得しましたから。
引退後10年近く放送活動はせず、静かにフィギュアスケートを含め冬季、夏季をはじめとする韓国スポーツ全体の発展のために働いていた。
スポーツ会社の経営陣として参加し、冬季と夏季スポーツを合わせて数多くの種目のメダリスト選手を後援しています。
2022年フィギュアスケートジュニア世界選手権女子フィギュア銀メダリストのシン·ジア選手も金妍兒が運営する会社所属。
本人が現役の時から国際的に活動しながら韓国体育を発展させるために見聞を広げることが好きでした。
度胸もあってメンタルも強く、生まれつきの器が大きい人です。
まだ若い年齢ですが、今も韓国内部ではスポーツ界の最大の大物です。"
"옷도 최고 연기력도 최고 몸매도 외모도 최고 섹시함 우아함 김연아를 능가하는 선수는 없다

そのため、キム·ヨナの兄夫が医師だということだ。

"キム·ヨナの旦那が最近のインタビューで「俺を好きになってくれる人より俺が好きな人の方が好きだ」 
と発言し、その発言直後に付け加えて「俺があなたのことがもっと好きだ」と話したことがあった。 
嫁のキムヨナに照れくさそうに告白するインタビューみたいでとても可愛かった。(笑)
彼は他のインタビューでは、「俺の恋人が異性の友達を多く持つことも絶対許さない」と強調した。 (笑)

"There hasn't been any legit advance in techniques in women's figure skating given all those cheated quads with poor quality. Not only that, the artistry component has been ruined and twisted as well. Nowadays the most combinations I see are feeble arms, stiff back and waist, poor pre-jump and post-jump posture, expressionless faces, program choreographed solely for getting points and nothing else. It's a mission impossible for audience to understand what those skaters are performing or attempting to portray on ice. ISU ruined the sport PERIOD."
虹の彼方へと、思いをのせて
"キム·ヨナとコ·ウリムは元々昨年結婚したがっていたが、コロナのせいで結婚式が延期されたという噂もある。

   Медведева и Загитова уделали в два счёта бы ,даже в лучшие годы не смогла бы Юна Ким соперничать 😞😞😞💥
 Юна Ким была хороша в свое время , но это и все ."
それは、とても大変な事です。
10年以上前の不正疑惑のあるスケーティングですね！この方は、今は何をしているのですか？浅田真央さんは、2年以上前から、毎月アイスショーを開き、チケットはほぼ完売しています！自分が座長となって全部、自分でしています。来年の秋にはメダルが取れるようなスケーターを育てる学校を作る予定です。これも全部、自分で運営していくそうです。金儲けやパフォーマンスの為だけに作られた企画に乗っかてる人と一緒にしないでください！
"私はこの演技好きだけど、点数をつけた人たちは嫌い。
当時のGOEは今より付きにくい印象だが、キムヨナだけ贔屓されたように加点されていた。
もっと他の選手にも、加点されるべき技術はあった。
フィギュアスケートを採点する側がフィギュアスケートを馬鹿にしているみたいだった。"

12年前ですか　んーん、浅田君に比べダイナミックさは有りますがスピンの腰が彼女より高いですね、優雅さ、女性の柔らかさは浅田君の方が有ります、今の高難度ジャンプに比較すると特に評価する物は無い普通に見えます　3A無しで浅田君に勝てたのは不思議ですね、今🌍️トップの🇷🇺女子ほ260点前後ですから223点？って見えましてけど、27点も違えばスキルの差は大きいですね。
なんでキムヨナが浅田真央の上なのか謎すぎる🤔失敗しないけど、ズルはする。
ぶるぶるするわ。ぶるぶる((⛄️))((( ；ﾟДﾟ)))
