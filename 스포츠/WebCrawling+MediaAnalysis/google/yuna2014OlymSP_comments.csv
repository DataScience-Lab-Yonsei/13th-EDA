Are you missing your favorite Olympic performance to music? Just let us know in the comments and we will add them to a future #MusicMonday!
Didn’t have to send in the clowns - the judges were already in the building 🙃
"When Queen Yuna said send in the clowns, the ISU really delivered that with their “judging”"
"2025. I only watch Yuna's performance on ice, so beautiful, graceful and peaceful. She is incomparable."
The fact that people are still talking about this scandal after 5 years speaks volumes @ISU
"5 years passed. But I can't forget the moment Yuna Kim was robbed her gold. She still be the Olympic champion, the legend and my favourite."
Yuna writes poetry on ice.
I’m happy to see that there are many people still remember her and the fact that her gold medal was stolen in Sochi. This short program is my favorite.
Two time Olympic Champion
"What stands out to me most about this performance is not her immaculate jumps and spins, but her grace and musicality. The way she flows through the ice with such expressiveness and paints a series of pictures with her body... this is the greatest artistry I've seen in figure skating."
"Hope sochi gold will go back to its true owner, Yuna Kim."
김연아의 연기는 항상 완벽했지만 그중에서도 꼽자면 소치올림픽의 완성도가 제일 높지 않을까 성인이 되면 기량이 떨어지는 타 선수와 달리 은퇴 직전의 올림픽에서 가장 물흐르듯 아름답고 숙련된 연기를 보여준 김연아... 동작 하나하나가 말그대로 교본이다 점프 스핀 연기 스파이럴 모든게 한순간의 끊김없이 이어지는 예술의 극치... 말그대로 장인의 모습이다 그저 동시대에 태어나 이런 작품을 볼 수 있단게 고마울 뿐
Millions around the world won’t remember the winner’s name but will remember the girl who was unfairly judged and robbed which was Yuna Kim.
"Nobody can skate so warm on a cold, hard rink like Yuna Kim."
Yuna is the real gold medalist in Sochi!!
연아 은퇴 후 가장 많이 찾아보는 프로그램이 쇼트는 어릿광대 프리는 레미제라블이 되었음. 진짜 저 고요한 분위기에 위로받는 느낌임
"No amount of quad jumps can compare to the grace and poise of Yuna Kim. She is still the greatest, ever."
"People keep talking about the free skate and how Yuna was robbed there. But what they don’t realize is that she was DRASTICALLY underscored in the short program. Given that she did a 3Lz+3T combo, while Adelina only did a 3T+3T, plus the fact that Yuna’s PCs are in a completely different league than Adelina’s, there’s absolutely no logical reason why they should have been virtually tied in the short program. Adelina should have been nowhere NEAR 74 in the SP, while Yuna should have gotten 79-80. That plan to ensure that a Russian lady would win the gold no matter what was long set in place before the free skate ever happened. Smdh."
이 무대는 이상하게 감동적임...그냥 너무 잘해서 보는게 아니라 감상하듯 보게됨..
The silence during her skate.. She brought peace to everyone’s hearts just for 2 minutes. The world became a better place for 2 minutes.
"5 years later and there has still not been a female skater that makes it look this seamless and effortless. Yuna really is in a class of her own, this was absolutely breathtaking 💕"
"벤쿠버때보다 훨씬 더 완성도있는
 플레이였다 
의상도 너무 아름다웠고  금메달을 놓친건 정말  피겨 역사에 남을 억울한 일이였다"
I can’t believe the Olympic community still shamelessly tries to capitalize off of the queen even after what they did to her. why don’t they flaunt sotnikova’s Olympic performances for views if she were great enough to claim gold?
"A truly beautiful performer. She's like water, flowing so easily without effort or resistance. I have never seen another figure skater with this level of grace and elegance. This woman will always hold a place in my heart. She doesn't have to prove anything anymore. She's a legend. She had already carved her name in the history of figure skating."
이 프로그램이 제일 좋다....버터 바른듯한 스스와 완벽한 점프와 비점프 프로그램 몰입도까지 진짜 이 프로그램은 완벽 그 자체다
It's 2019 and I'm still mad about her not winning an undoubtedly deserved gold medal
I'm sure that IOC MUST know who is the true sochi champion. Give back sochi gold to Yuna Kim.
"As a Canadian, I love Yuna Kim so much and I feel she is a legend! She absolutely should have deserved gold, but we as a world know the truth. She sends shivers down my spine and I'm not even a figure skater. Just the elegance, the grace, and the beauty with which she skates ... a Picasso on ice"
"Of all the gold medalist skaters I have seen, none can compare to Yuna Kim. Those skaters put of a show that when they are finish watching you say WoW! but you do not want to see it again, but when Yuna Kim starts skating, you do not want her to stop, because her dance is gracious, elegant, passionate, peaceful, like an art. A beautiful Art. When you see an an art that you love you want to buy it, and put it in your room, or house to see it everyday, because it gives you peace."
2-time Olympic champion.
"Kim's performances in Vancouver were brighter, but those in Sochi were perfect. One sees her movements in ""Send in the Clowns"" and ""Adios Nonino"" and realizes that they cannot be improved. I haven't seen anything like it in women's figure skating. Nowadays skaters are achieving more and more spins in the air and dizzying scores, but none offers a polished and well rounded work like Yuna Kim."
Score should be 80+
two time olympic champion
"Definitely GOLD!
Look up the history:  this was definitely not judged properly; she should have won 100%."
"*TEXTBOOK* ---this is what makes Yuna on another level. There are days when she missed her jumps but on good days, she makes everything look so easy,which is not. Pure talent, grace, feminine, beautiful body, long slim arms and legs. An excellent jumper and artist on the ice. She is the total package...even today."
Sochi stole Yuna's glory to be called the Best Ever.
This is simply the most beautiful skate I have ever seen.
Are they serious posting this thinking we've forgot what robbery happened there? It will be in history forever and everyone will know the real winner's name and It is Yuna Kim
You don't know how many times I have rewatched this performance. And I'm gonna be rewatching it again.
This performance by Yuma Kim is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life!
아직도 점프의 퀄리티를 따라올 자가 없다.. 처음 스피드랑 트럿트토 견고한거보소..ㄷㄷ
She is like a yellow butterfly flying in the beautiful grass. It's such a beautiful skating
"How can the component score of current ladies competitors is higher than this masterpiece?.. Absolutely stunning, gorgeous, beautiful.. I really miss Queen Yuna."
연기 진짜 넘사벽이다... 기술 성공하려고 악쓰는게 아니라 기술을 연기의 일부로 부드럽게 연결하는거 너무 아름다워
"If someone asks what figure skating is, show them Yuna Kim's program."
지금봐도 최고다..   음악과 연기가 하나가 된 듯한 흐름..    여왕의 품격.  우아함이 넘침..
"잠깐 신이 내려와서 아름다운 춤을 추고 간 것 같아
감히 평가를 할 수 없는 무대지 너무 귀한 분이라"
1:34 That flip is one of the best quality that I've ever seen....
"No skater.  NONE has ever conveyed the "" feeling"" of music like Yuna Kim.  What a treasure.   She is the Virtue and Moire, Jason Brown/Lambiel/Buttle, Sale and Pelltier of Women's skating."
"Queen Yuna. Vancouver and Sochi olympic champion. 
I miss Yuna's flawless performance. She is the GOAT of figure skating."
"Stunning program, and her lutz is the best I’ve seen, still to this day. The clowns were already there. On the judging panel."
This is the most beautiful routine I've ever seen . . . brings me to tears.
So graceful... She is a Legend. Simply the best. Long live the Queen!
Figure Skating will never be the same again without Queen Yuna!
Perfection and beauty on ice.  When judges get it wrong....and the world knows.
Just 74! This deserved to be 80
"The most perfect legend with dignity, intelligence, skills, and beauty. Her last message to everyone who loved her was harmony, forgiveness, hope, and love, not the ""gold medal."" It's more valuable than the gold medal she lost, so we'll remember.  Thank you for your dignity. You are always Queen Yuna. Long live the queen"
"ISU needs reform, and shame on you IOC."
"She is more than an athlete - she is an artist, her art transcending the barrier of language and cultural differences. Embodies the true spirit of the Olympics."
Truly a generational talent she was. I’ve never seen anyone match her in modern figure skating
"It's 2022 and I'm still back for her beautiful performance. I've just watched Sotnikova's program to see how she did, and yeah, that was her greatest performance ever, but it can never match Yuna's. Yuna's performance exactly defines what 'art' means. Her every move flows with the music.

Truely unmatched perfection. I honestly don't think I'll ever get to see anyone who'll be at her level for the rest of my life."
ironic it`s called send in the clowns when the judges acted like absolute clowns with their cheating
"This woman is the most beautiful , athletic skater that ever performed .. so beautiful .. this is figure skating"
Nobody skates like Yuna. Full of grace.
Yuna Kim is two-time olympic champion. Shame on Russia. IOC MUST re-mark sochi ladies' single game. Sochi scandal is the biggest and disgraceful scandal in the history of figure skating.
"Elegance, Refinement, Beauty, Talents, Poise, Femininity, Confidence..All in one."
"Not too many of God's angels in the world these days but Yuna is on of them.
Flawless perfection, beauty and a humility which is extraordinary. Not getting
the gold in Sochi was a Russian joke. How can you beat perfection?"
This performance was like the queen's last poem of love and gratitude to her fans. It was a performance that could only come out at the highest level of technology and art. I don't think there will ever be a skater like Queen Yuna again. Yuna is just an eternal queen. I truly respect her. I love you. Long live the queen.
She is 2 times Olympic champion from Vancouver and Sochi.
this is still my favorite ice skating routine to watch. i always come back to this one. just puts you at peace.
"Yuna is one of those rare skaters who skates so beautifully, when you watch her you simply feel entranced."
"It's so funny to compare the titles you have given for Sotnikova and Kim's performances.
 ""Yuna Kim claims silver with a superb performance"" and ""Yuna Kim's breathtaking performance to Send in the Clowns"" versus ""Sotnikova's gold medal winning performance"".
Ah, Olympic Channel, you are so delightfully shading."
She makes it look so easy and graceful.
"Gosh this is ART, she's magical."
Sochi stole her medal.She is the best skater ever.
"이토록 아름다운 순간이 있을 수 있는가
볼 때마다 눈물나게하는 공연이다
드레스색상마저 고혹적이다
진실에 침묵하는 인간들은 이 순간만큼은 내 알 바 아니고 분노도 생각나지않음 그저 이 아름다움에 눈물"
IOC knows who’s the best! Because they don’t post any video of Adelina’s.
"This short program is so underrated. This only got 74.92 which I think is way too low for this performance. I know that skating in earlier groups didn't help with the score, but her SP was one the most technically difficult SP of the night. Her SP in Vancouver was good, but Send in the Clown was way better in term of maturity and grace. James Bond SP was playful and flirty but in term of skating skill she has grown in the span of 4 years. The step sequence (which was only marked level 3, such a crime) is so effortless compared to you know who (I am tired being salty with the ""gold"" medalist) that got level 4 with shallow edge, rushed steps, and arms flailing all over the place. But art will always find its place in people hearts and I can assure you that more people will come back to this performance compared to the ""gold"" medalist performance."
No one can ever be like her. She is the greatest ladies singles skater ever.
"I missed her again and again.
Forever be our Queen 👸
Yuna you're one of a kind ."
"제 아무리 네 바퀴 다섯 바퀴 뛰어봐라  저렇게  물흐르듯이 우아하게 스케이트 타는 사람 없다...
 3분동안 사람혼을 쏙 빼놓음"
One of the softest and the most musical program ever exist in figure skating
"김연아의 이 쇼트 연기는 내 평생 본 모든 선수 , 모든 프로그램 중 최고였다.
음표 하나하나 놓치지 않고 눈빛 몸짓으로 완벽하게 다 표현해낸다.  연기에 녹아든 점프도 너무나 매끄럽고 완벽하다 goe5점짜리  점프다 .
트랜지션 스케이트스킬 퍼포먼스 음악의표현 모두 만점이고.  인간이 이 보다 더 잘하는건 불가능하다.
현존하는 스케이터 중에 이 프로그램을 이렇게 표현할 스케이터는 없다. 단연코  김연아 외엔~ 
기술43 연기40 = 83점은 받아야한다."
"is there anyone who can skate like this today? I don't think so. The spring in her jumps, the effortless speed and glide, the simple but absolute stunning elegance! She really flies across the ice."
Should have been the 2014 Olympic champion.
Give her back the gold. Make two medals I don‘t care. Just get the gold where it belongs
Send in the Clowns nicely foreshadows what has happened to skating
This is my absolute favourite performance. She flows like water. No one can compare.
어릿광대를 보내주오는 연기 음악 다 좋지만 특히 진짜 스텝이 아름다운것같음. 움직일때마다 얼음에 그려지는 호선이 선명하고 또 음악이랑도 너무 잘 어우러짐. 꼭 주기적으로 봐줘야 되는 프로그램..
"I have not watched Yuna's skate for a long time. Now that I came here, I, one more time, understood that why she was the best ever. Everything about her is magical. No matter how big the scores are nowadays, no one comes close to her skating and I doubt anyone will ever any time soon."
Eight years passed I still come back and rewatch the true champ's performance. Miss you Yuna
キムヨナの、何かを祈るような演技が忘れられない。こんなに美しく滑るスケーターは今後も現れないだろうな。
The real queen on ice.
This is the most ethereal performance I have ever seen.
"Sorry to say this but the Russian audience and staff were particularly rude when yuna performed. 

According to multiple spectators, some of the staff members made a middle finger towards yuna when she performed. Not only to yuna but they were also very rude to other non Russian skaters’ performances. They were chanting Russia before yuzuru’s team sp and after yuzu finished clean there were just silence. I really don’t know how yuna managed to skate clean with all this."
"난 이거 볼 때 마다 울컥울컥하닥 그렁그렁 해짐
저 안무가 표현하고자 하는 감정이 고스란히 전달이 댐 ㅠㅠ
화려하진 않아도 심금을 울리는 연기라는 게 이런 걸 말하지 않을까.."
Long Live the Queen Yuna!!!   She is the real Queen on the ice!!!    She is just natural Beauty and Elegance!!!    I miss her bad...
You could hear a pin drop when she skates. She's mesmerizing
The best female skater I’ve known.. that’s artistry on ice
Who needs quads when you have this ? No one skates with this artistic and graceful anymore. It is all about jumping now...
"According to my friend who watched there live, Russians had no respect to all the skaters (except to their Russian skaters), the most 'hated' by Russians performance wise was Yuna Kim and Yuzuru Hanyu's (either they shout 'Russia' or did not even clap, mind you most of the audience there was Russians so even of there were some applause, imagine if only a handful of people will do so, so rude). I'm amazed by the mental courage of Yuna, Yuzuru and all the skaters who competed at Sochi since, the crowd there so rowdy and lacks decorum."
"Whenever the olympics is nearing, I keep coming back to this performance."
She was gold medal itself. She looks so gorgeous in yellow dress.
"I always remember that moment in sochi when I watched the show live in tv. I almost cried to the performance. Her figure skating is in another level... Refined, full of artistry, her clean jumps, the grace in  skating the ice.. Everything is powerful. Beautiful. Magnificent.

But yet she was robbed with that GOLD.
Yuna Kim will always be the ONLY ICE QUEEN."
I watches this a million times. She’s like an Angel when she skates.
Sochi 2014 Gold Medalist Yuna Kim
꿈에서 갑자기 깨어난 것처럼 1분도 안된 것 같은데 끝나있어.. 완벽한 실력도 대단한데 다시봐도 무대 몰입력이 정말 최고다
"I just saw this performance for the first time (Dec, 2021). It is perhaps the most beautiful skate I've ever seen. Yuna Kim is utterly bewitching on the ice ..."
"다 좋지만 그 중에도 내가 제일 좋아하는 프로그램중 하나.  모든 동작과 몸짓, 표정에 버릴게 하나도 없다 정말.  나비요정......"
I think yuna 2014's game was better art show than 2010's.
"This is the most peaceful, serene, delicate, and ethereal performance ever."
You really know that she made an impact on figure skating when people still call her the GOAT and the queen of ice after almost 10 years since she retired.
Not even a figure skating fan but this performance by Yuna Kim brings me to tears. Absolutely just beautiful 🥲
"개인적으로 김연아 선수 연기들 중에서 소치 올림픽 때 연기를 제일 사랑해요. 레미제라블, 어릿광대를 보여주오 엄청 많이 돌려봤고 여전히 찾아보게 되는 영상이에요."
"Really she was foreshadowing the olympic judging with the lyrics ""send in the clowns, don't bother there here""!! As well as the systematic doping of her competitor Adelina the silver medalist! Yuan Kim has done more for the sport than the ISU has done, shame on you ISU. We are still discussing this TEN YEARS LATER and it's still prevalent."
World record program here. 5 years later and I still can’t believe.
"キムヨナの演技の中で
最も過小評価されたのはこのプログラムでしょう
彼女の競技人生に於いても
フィギュアスケートの歴史に於いても
1位の座をを争う名演技だと思います
見る度に儚い美しさに溺れて
涙が自然に出てくる"
Tara Lipinski on Yuna Kim “It’s just unbelievable. I’ve done it. I watch it. I’m in awe. I don’t know how. She’s perfect”
I’ll never tire of watching this performance. It is timeless.
All my burdens melt down into tears. She showed the heaven where we came from.
"3Flip alone is worthy the gold medal. The most aesthetic single triple jump from a women I've ever witness because technique of the jump , the way she executing , the way she landing and the timing of the musical is sooooooo perfect!!!!! + she landing with such deep knee bend and glide like a swan"
The way everytinggg she does is soooo graceful and effortless.
"my favorite program. She is my number one, and real champion in sochi."
"この演技後に安藤が
「曲との一体感、技術も本当に全てが素晴らしかった!!! かっこいいの一言!!! 怪我を乗り越えてこの場に来てこの演技 。本当に凄いと思う。感動しました(*^_^*)」
続いて「Wow Yuna!!! Was so great and I almost cry...She is really great skater!!! Xoxo」
とtweet。
同業者ならではの声だけに心に響いた。

たしかに本当に氷上での演技か？！と思えるくらい蝶のような軽やかな演技。
3:05なんか簡単そうに見えるけど至難の技。
同じ技やってたスケーターがすっ転んでたし。"
True gold medalist
One of the most graceful and superlative skaters  in history.
HOW DARE HOW DARE YOU THE OLYMPICS LET THIS SCANDAL HAPPEN. LET YUNA KIM RISE AGAIN THE ONE AND ONLY OLYMPIC CHAMPIONN
"Honestly, how dare you upload and capitalize off this video after disrespecting her so awfully at Sochi..."
True champion of Sochi... Figureskating fans still miss her
She is way more important than the medals. Protect her at all cost
Queen Yuna Kim💕 Thank you Olympic Channel for fulfilling my request
Flawless. The most beautiful skater I've ever seen.
everyone knows who is the true gold medalist and the champion of the female figure skating in 2014 :)
骷髅之舞和小丑进场，一动一静，一个如暗夜之花张扬狂放，一个如秋叶飘落静水流深，都是女单短节目巅峰之作，永远的yuna kim！
Never thought that I was capable of holding my breath for 3 minutes while watching this breathtakingly gorgeous skating ...Yuna Kim is the legend...
"Yuna Kim was stolen of gold medal from the russian mafia...

Never seen this glamour, perfection, sweetness... Pure Art"
모두가 알고있어 김연아가 금메달이라는걸.
"There's nothing like this out there now, nothing. Unmatched perfection."
"This performance will be remembered as a MASTERPIECE!🥺 Especially, her 3Lz is literally gorgeous and huge. How can this be real? She must be an angel lol"
She beautiful!  A stunning butterfly on ice!  🦋⛸🦋
It makes me tear up and be more emotional than when i first saw this program. Kim yuna is a queen forever nobody skates as effortlessly as she does.
"Yuna got married today in Seoul. Congrats, my queen! I miss you so much!!"
"The universe knows she is Two time Olympic champion at 2010,2014."
"Just watched the team event. The Russian girl got a score of 90.18 and I thought how much the scoring have changed coz I believe this short program is one of the best I've ever watched and should have gotten that type of scoring too. Boy, how I missed this legend."
"Miss Yuna,
You can create peace in the world with this performance! So healing!"
"Perhaps the greatest Olympic champion (in the women). The full package: technical ability (pure jumping technique, lightness, speed, flow and distance) and artistry (musicality, performance ability, skating skills)."
Real Two time Olympic Champion
People knows when they wittnessing greatness. and her performance has few to compare.
"Underscored, tbh. So effortless and exquisite, just like skating should be"
"When she skates, you can see she embodies the spirit of life itself—again and again she becomes the truest version of Self. Brings me to tears."
this was her best shade to IOC-- what makes her a great skater beyond her stage presence is that she is smart...
truly the best of all time
All of my 30 years of being an Ice Skating fan only Yuna Kim moved me. And no one else. I'd stopwatch Ice skated ever since Kim Yuna said goodbye to the ice arena.
Pure legend.  Glad that you were born in my time frame for me to enjoy watching your performance.
Why am I crying? This is still so beautiful!
2014 Olympic Champion . Queen Yuna
"She always said that if she felt she had done well on her own despite the unfair score, that was enough. It breaks my heart to think of the process of her accepting it like that."
Figure skating will never be the same without the queen yuna kim. The truly best of all time .
"Азиатская мягкость , нежность лучей восходящего солнца , такт и пластика - это Юна Ким ! Истинная чемпионка"
It’s so moving to watch mature skater on the ice in 2022. Beautiful!
"If Vancouver performances were energetic and powerful and passionate, Sochi performances were beautiful and graceful and elegant and mature."
There are certain moments that stay with you forever. Watching Kim Yuna's Olympic performances is one of those.
i still cannot believe that this performance was underscored. It should be above 78.00 - 80 thou
"Her 3Flip alone is enough to win the short program by a mile 

So perfectly straight line and minimal prerotation with  so tight and straightness air position🥺🙏 soft knee action on the landing with  her arm movement that make her 3Flip even more artistic looking than other ladies"
"Performance by a true master of figure skating. This is so beautiful, delicate, elegant and her performance can't be matched with any other performance at 2014 Sochi Olympics. Name any skater in Ladies Singles who performed 4 clean programs at two Olympics. Simply the best!"
The personification of brilliance.  A glimpse into Heaven.
This performance still makes me cry in 2021
never forget this sport is about figure skating and artistic..!!! True queen <3
that performance is still the most beautiful skating I have ever witnessed
really two time Olympic champion!!! i missed her skating on ice.. ⛸⛸
"너무 아름답고 가슴이 아픈 프로그램이에요. 시간이 많이 흘렀지만 아마 앞으로도 나에겐 다시없을 영원한 퀸입니다.
행복하세요 연아선수"
"i can´t even put into words how magical this is... i feel like once yuna steps on the ice it´s not about competition anymore, it´s much more about true beauty and raw emotions (cause omg the final spin ALWAYS has me crying). my favorite performance of all time. she´s perfection. she´s art. she´s history."
"Two Times Olympic Champion ! The Queen, Yuna Kim 😍"
"샌딘은 2007 종달새의 비상을 볼 때의 감동과 비슷한 느낌.. 김연아만의 아련함과 섬세함 너무 좋음ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 소치 샌딘은 매일 봐도 안 질릴 것 같음. 소름끼치도록 아름다움 
살면서 본 여자 싱글 쇼트 프로그램 중에 제일 좋아함"
One of the most beautiful skaters I've ever seen.  She's is so graceful and has a fluidity that many skaters are never going to achieve.
"Skating Skills is 10 out of 10!!! No one can complete this level today

Softness & effortless, speed into and out of jumps , transitions , deep knee bend on every landings of her jump , very deep edges throughtout performance , such control on everythings"
"개인적으로 저때의 의상이 가장 아름답다고 생각함.
겨울의 여왕이 아닌 봄의 여신 같았음"
"Our two-time gold champion. Also, figure skating hasn't been the same since Sochi, I miss our well-rounded skaters who can actually hold a deep edge"
The score should have been higher for this magnificent performance. Queen of the skating world!
Perfect Score in my book. Sochi stole her honor but she rose above it.🎉
I searched the word perfection in the dictionary and there was this woman's picture.
"Grace, Beauty, technique, artistry and ""heart"" - in one complete skater.   And I know everyone says the Free program was undermarked but she was *WAY* undermarked here in this short program."
"두번의 올림픽에서 그녀의 연기를 볼수있었던 우리는 행운아들임,,
수십년뒤에도 전설로 남을 그녀의 플레이를 실제로 봤으니까요! 

삶이 힘들때 이 경기를 보면서 위로를 받고 감사해요
연아씨 고마워요 ❤"
Two Time Olympic Champion
Two Time Olympic Champion.👑👑
"Today is the tenth anniversary of this eternal masterpiece of a performance, isn't it? It's so beautiful!"
My two time Olympic champion 👑
Yuna’s programs just never gets old. No matter how many times you watch it. It cures my soul.
Watching this instead of the circus that is the Beijing Olympics
Cant count how many times I've watched  this one and still get goosebumps every single time. Yuna is forever the Queen. My heart sinks feeling bad for her as she  should have been given the Gold. This Send in the Clowns was absolutely perfect.
"Glad to see that all the scorn for the gold medal decision is being directed towards the judges and not Sotnikova. It’s pretty clear who should have won, but the decision isn’t any skater’s fault.

And that said, you can tell how special Kim was. This program is one of my favorites. It’s so soft and vulnerable while still being technically difficult and close to perfect."
"Queen Yuna Kim is a  true legend of Drug Free Era.
SOCHI stole her Gold Medal."
Thank you. This is my favourite Short Programme. I always watch this when I am down.
The truly owner of the gold medal in Sochi! She is a QUEEN!
"I have this video saved.  When I'm stressed or just having a bad day I return to it.  And for a few golden moments, my soul takes flight with this extraordinary young woman."
This is the most peaceful thing I've ever seen. Incredible.
This can be called a masterpiece. It is too underrated.
2022 and I still crying watch this 🥰
It’s 2021 and I’m still not over this.
"My One and Only Queen
Long Live the Queen YUNA 👑
Two-Time Olympic Champion 🥇"
"Yuna is everything you want from the ladies champion , I mean complete package at highest level

 Speed across the ice  ✅
Jump technique ✅
Edge quality ✅ 
knee action ✅
Superb musical interpretation ✅ Delicated choerography ✅ 
Body comitment and facial expression feel the music✅
Effortless on the ice✅"
I am watching it first tym I heard her name before..it's gold medal worthy performance why she got silver why Olympic is nt fair ....u can change the medal but u can't change wht u did ..such an amazing artist....no can stole her art from her Yuna can create more like her but Olympic can't give Yuna her tht moment back
Her jumps look so soft.
"That girl was the Comaneci of figure skating. People have upgraded on more difficulty but nobody even the very talented up and coming skaters, is able to move, jump and synchronize with music with such intuition, such fluidity and natural ability. One in a billion"
"My opinion on watching this absolute masterpiece echoes those that commented before mine. It’s truly as if watching an Angel skate on ice. It moves me to tears every single time. No other skater on the planet has ever done that for me, personally. Queen Yuna Kim will always be the Gold winner for 2014, and beyond."
Just perfect....  Just art....  I don't care it was for golden medal or silver medal any more.  She is just different level than all other competitors.  She is a real queen.
Both technically and artistically flawless. We can't imagine how hard it was for her to perform a perfect performance. Thank you Yuna!
"I have to agree, with most everyone I know's sentiments about her superior performance and the gold SHOULD have been hers!"
My favorite next to Les Miserables. This performance is full of emotions. I love Yuna Kim.
"so perfect, i am in my tears!

why this was not available until 2019?"
"Elegant, expressive and with strong technique in a program that was a pleasure to watch. That is what figure skating is all about."
"Много лет поклонница ФК, скажу честно это лучшее что было в ФК.Такая элегантность, нежность, женственность, притягательность. Юна лучшая фигуристка всех времен и народов"
"My all time favorite performance ever, and will be forever. Long live the Queen!"
Невероятно! Просто фантастика!  Она прекрасна в этой программе.
"The One and Only: Queen Yu-Na
2x Olympic Champion 🥇🥇"
"That Jumps, That Edges, That Flow Just Glorious"
연아 님 이런 감동적인 프로그램을 연기해주셔서 항상 감사합니다
모든 것이 완벽해서 점수가 무의미하게 느껴지는 예술의 경지. 가장 좋아하는 프로그램. 사랑해요 김연아.
The queen! Can we go back in time please? I miss QUALITY in figure skating.
IT'S 2023 AND WE STILL WANT JUSTICE FOR YUNA KIM!!!
She is the ALL TIME LEGEND… perfect as all
감상하게 되는 유일한 피겨연기.
"How beautiful, how gentle... She's like the most beautiful flower 💛 I'm Kazakh and I love Queen Yuna so much"
Beautiful performance. Perfect 3Lz+3T combo. Real queen 🥇🥇👑 Her gold medal was robbed by Russia. RIP ISU.
I can feel the loneliness and sorrows in this number. She skates beyond amazing and so beautiful
I love programs like this because it is relaxing and fun to watch. The only thing i can think about fs performances these days is if the skater is going to fall or not.
"so stunning performance, she is an artist"
A TRUE LEGEND
"Still breathtakingly beautiful in 2024, Yuna was the true gold medalist."
2023년에도 보는 사람?
she looks like a butterfly😢😢😢😢😢 truly magnificent
"I'm not a consistent figure skating fan, but seeing this video of Yuna's golden perfection one wonders if the clowns in the melody weren't seated at the judges chairs. Seriously??? This performance did not deserve gold? The sheer arrogance of these 0:03  ""judges"" !!!"
"I don't  know why this performance makes me emotional....I cry again.
So beautiful 😍"
"Breathtaking skating skills between 3-3 combi and 3 flip , Edge is so deep that side of blades almost touching ice, usually there's no time to showing skate skills in short program ; have to many components in short time, but she perform upper body choreography with insane class skills. And also look like effortless. How glorious skating of skating pioneer."
"Never Never more a Skater like Yuna Kim

A Legend
An incredible athlete and incredible graceful artist"
She is still best performer ever
A magnificent performance. The best skater of my lifetime.
Sorry but for me this is the most beautiful short program ever 💚
Who is comeback here after Beijing 2022 ladies short program ?
"Absolute beauty, her skating is exquisite, she became the music! Gold medal to say the least!"
"The most memorable skating performance I’ve ever had the privilege of watching, simply stunning."
Yuna is the best female figure skater ever. Simply the best.
The most graceful short program of ladies' discipline in the history. Sublime!
"I swear, figure skaters are amazing. The sport itself is super hard (I mean you're skating and doing all those moves on ice with shoes that have thin blades), but they make it look so effortless."
This brought me to tears. Just gorgeous. Uncontested queen.
"This is a masterpiece, and it proves why she is true champion ."
The first 5 seconds and i was already convinced it was the best performance I would see. This is my first time watching her. I cant believe someone actually was better and took gold?! I will have to look it up and watch now!
"This program proves figure skating still can be as artistic as fine arts, even though scoring system doesn’t encourage to do this. I hope someday in sooner future, I can witness an artistic program piece just like Yuna did in Sochi no matter what color of her or his medal is."
Wears a gold costume because she knows they’re not going to give her the gold medal. FIRST PLACE IN MY HEART !!!
"i don't think anyone but her could have pulled off that dress, she really looks stunning"
She is a legend.
"This is one of the most beautiful elegant, graceful dances I have ever see."
"Yuna Kim, Yuna Qween!!! True winner of Sochi's olimpic!!!"
The Queen.  It is always thrilling to watch her skate or just to see her.
"I cried then, I cried now....So beautiful program.... Queen Yuna ❤️❤️❤️"
This is so gorgeous and incredibly talented it brings tears to my eyes
"I'm absolutely speechless. plz let me know how to express her performance.
her face expression, body movement, the tip of her hand and music, they are all harmonized.
I still don't get it how come russian judge didn't give her a better score.
sochi Olympic smelled so fishy."
She seems like gracefully floating on ice in this program.❤
Truly mesmerizing. She's now become my new definition of elegance
"Women's figure skating isn't like this anymore. Now it's all about that 180° pre-rotated ""quad"" u win"
She deserved the second gold.
Elegant athleticism that looks easy when you’re the best. Beautiful routine for the musical setting too.
It doesn't matter if I watch this performance a thousand times.  I'll always get goosebumps.
She is the only champion 🏆 in our memory. The most beautiful and artistic performance ever♡
"""Эмоциясыз сырғанау"" дейді кейбіреулер, бірақ өз басым Ёнаның конькиінің жүзіне қарасам көзіме жас келеді 😭 Нағыз өнер иесі! Балерина! Иә, ресейлік қыздардың иілгіштігі супер және контенттері өте күрделі. Бірақ Ёнаның сырғанауында ешкімде жоқ ерекшелік бар!"
How come that incredible program scored so low? She was robbed at the SP as well
Two Time Olympic Champion 👑⛸🥇🥇
"The best performance I have ever seen 
Gold!"
Just Legend...... She was the queen.
Her skating just melts in with the music. It seems like her performance creates music not that she’s skating to the music. So powerful yet soft and beautiful.
This program is on my mind today... 💖✨no reason✨💖
Such an effortless elegance!  There’s no one like Yuna Kim.
So so so beautiful! I am still moved by this particular program! I could not count how many times I have watched this. Thank you for her exceptional artistry!
Yuna is all time legend.
"No one can glide as graceful as Yuna❤
Thank you for this special tribute.
She deserves the best🥇"
So much grace. Love watching her performance.
Ballet on ice! At this point she is in a league of herself
"Whenever I watch any of her programs, it's like I am put under a spell.  She is so mesmerizing and ethereal in her interpretation of the music.  She surely was robbed of her second Gold medal in Sochi.  I wonder if she could have won with Les Miserables instead of Adios Nonino?  I feel like that could have carried the momentum and nudged a win for her.  The tango piece was superb, but a bit dark and sad.  Les Mis had a lot better energy that could have had the crowd roaring for her."
"One of the bravest athletes I have ever known!  

Yuna Kim has, is, and will always remain an inspiration!  And this is one of her most beautiful performances! 

God Bless the Queen 😊❤️🌸👑🏆🤙🏼👏"
"I'm still mad she didn't get her rightful gold and Kostner her silver, but at least even the Olympic Channel knows who the real winner is"
I think she is a real gold medalist
i am new to figure skating but this might be the best performance i´ve ever seen. her facial expressions gave me goosebumps. this is pure art
"I'm on the less emotional side of people, but Kim's skating really does bring a little tear to my eyes;;; so beautiful!!!"
Still phenomenal. Kept coming back to this performance
"The best ever in the history.
The last figure skating that was true figure skating.
After this, it has become circus and jumping competition."
"She deserved the gold let's be fr, Olympics need to stop favouritism"
The best short program in ladies figure skating
2020. She is here. I'm still here.
This is the most beautiful ice skating performance I have ever seen 😳
Two-time Olympic champion!!! ❤️❤️❤️
this performance is so peaceful and beautiful.
"My comfort program 💛
The spread eagle into the 2A is one of my favorite jumping passages of all times"
Two time olympic gold medalist
The most beautiful performance ever.
idc how much later it is it’s never to late to address the pure disrespect towards this beautiful woman and the invasion of her Olympic gold. she deserves an apology.
"I love her jumps. They are always high, fast and steady..."
"I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this program! And when the times are dark I'm here again - to be reminded of the presence of beauty in the world! Simplicity, grace, musicality and sincerity blended into pure magic! Thanks, Queen Juna! ♥"
"Beautiful, graceful, perfect, perfect, perfect! Fantastic!"
"Love, Love , Love this programm! Such an exquisite masterpies!"
Technically n choreographic perfect. Her moves are poetic n angelic!
the fact that I'm in the same timeline and universe as Queen Yuna is wild.
It's such a beautiful skating. Love her performance. Simply the best. She is a legend 💛
Flawless. Absolutely flawless. Long live the Queen.
다시봐도 눈물나는 연기입니다...!
"We all know how great she was, and STILL her speed across the ice is not matched, but her elegance and how she presented a routine was on a completely different level.  And still is.  She is the only skater to make a man cry.  X"
"Какие же прекрасные чувства вызывает эта Королева у нас, у её преданных поклонников! Это что-то неземное, воздушное... Искусство в чистом виде! Такая одухотворенная программа 💚👸"
This is one of the most beautiful ice skating performances I've ever watched! 😍
"*The real GOLD MEDALIST. The Russian Adelina Sotnikova stole and robbed the gold medal from Ms. Kim. Sotnikova, the Russian, is undeserving. An unelegant, unrefined skater. She didn't at all deserve the gold medal which was and is rightfully Yuna Kim's.*"
She is the real queen.
"My favourite short program 😊
Long Live the Queen 👑 Yuna Kim 🌹"
A true skater in a drug-free era
This should take 85 because no one have a jumps or sequence like her ever
2024 and i still can't get over this performance
Two time Olympic Champion Yuna Kim everyone!
perfect technique and wonderful artistry
"she complimented the tone and texture of this music so incredibly effortlessly and tenderly...with such included difficulty.   at times like this watching someone like her, i love my sport."
"ive seen many great skaters, even current ones, but shes the most connected to the music, literally"
"I usually don't enjoy slow music, but I really love this! The choreography and her outfit mesh so well with the music selection. Imo 3:03 is the perfect example of such a moment when the music, the choreography, and her outfit all work together. Her movements and the way her sleeves floated together was just perfect! Sounds weird but the delicate fluidity of this performance reminds me of water, everything just flowed."
Why am I crying at this performance? :/
she is the real goldmedalist. 💛don't forget it..queen yuna.
This is my favourite program of Yuna's but it hurts to watch it because it reminds me of how much she was robbed!
The most beautiful short program
My favorite music in Ballet.  I cry when I hear it.  She did a beautiful skate to the music.
She won the gold medal.  Crooked judges.
This beautiful Olympic champion queen Yuna is getting married in October! congratulations!
Two Time Olympic Champion.
"All clean, smooth as silk, extremely touching performance, everything is seamless and artistic , and natural. What else can I ask for. 
浑然天成，余音袅袅"
Let's not forget Yuna who is beautiful and outstanding.
She is the best
She is the best  for ever and ever!♥
"그녀는  이미  알고있었을지도  모른다. 이날의  분위기.그리고  이미  정해져있는 결과까지도.
 그럼에도 불구하고 이렇게  평온하고 침착하겨  본인의 모든 수행을  완벽하게  보여줬다는것 그  자체가 이미    차원이  다른 실력과 정신력을  입증하는 것이며, 이것이야말로  진정한 여왕의  품격이다.
  김연아  이후로  많은 기술이  더  발달되어 점프회전수의  업그레이드,기술력의  진화 등에 성공한  잘하는  선수들은  몇몇  있었지만,  이렇게  우아하고  아름다운  기품이  느껴지는 선수는  아직까지  보지 못했다."
Artistry on ice.  Perfection!
마지막 스핀에서의 고요와 침묵은 진짜 뭔가 말로 설명할순 없는 오묘한 감정을 준다
What a beautiful performance by Yuna Kim to a beautiful song written by Steven Sondheim
2:51 favorite moment
People are still watching Yuna's performance yet nobody really cares about the Russian skaters.
Figure Skating of these days is just a jumping show with no artistry. They just try to compete who can spin more. I feel bad that I cannot see such a beautiful program like yuna’s anymore. She’s a true legend.
Who is watehing this is 2021?❤️
"Her movement was charming
She's the best skater..."
G.O.A.T!! Legend. The artistry of her performance is breathtaking. So sad skating has gone downhill after she retired. Now doped up russians are ruining this beautiful sport with not a single ounce of artistry nor soul.
"Now this is a skate , now some skater because of quad people think they are great but for me the skate should be this , this is technicaly and artistry amazing♡♡"
A masterpiece ❤️
What a very soulful performance.
"Simplemente, Espectacular! The Queen."
The world has not forgotten what the ISU did in 2014 and continues to do. They should be forever shamed for giving Yuna’s gold metal away. They are still inflating Russian skater scores with undeserving technical marks. SMH 🤦‍♀️.
It’s only been one month since I knew Kim yuna and i watched this 5k times
"Quads?  No thanks... I'll take this.  Elegance, fluidness, and femininity personified."
"wow! her artistic performance is still the best in the world! no one is near to her! Eventhough russian girls do more jumps than her, her artistics, dancing, hand movement, emotion and choreography is the best of all time."
This makes me want to cry.....
Love her performance
"Anyone with a brain would’ve seen that Yuna OBVIOUSLY should’ve won the gold. Even if that’s not what happened, it doesn’t matter. Everyone, Even Russia knows Yuna won."
"Such an amazing performance thatshe  deserves the title Queen Yuna. No one could replace such a beautiful, graceful and elegant human being, the one and only Yuna Kim."
yuna kim is the best♡
I still don’t understand why she didn’t win the gold
"This is my most favourite Yuna performance and it touches me every time, really.   She makes me think that snow fairies would have skated so easily and elegantly like she does."
She is so graceful.
"Shame on you, IOC.  You guys are too dirty and small.  Never ever say IOC represents sports spirit especially in front of our kids."
“Yes Sotnikova scored very high. That is very generous….coming from the judges panel” -best quote of the century 😂 Give Yuna her Gold medal 🥇!!!
Long live the Queen 👑
これは本当に素晴らしかった
10년이 지나서 다시 보니 저때 김연아 선수에게는 메달 색이 중요했던건 아닌거 같아요.. 물론 금메달 연기였지만 ㅎㅎ 이 자체로 완벽하게 아름답고 감동을 주는 프로그램이네요
La verdadera ganadora en Sochi
Queen Yuna
Oh that was so beautiful. My neck hair and every hair on my arms stand up. She was floating like an angel. Wonderful 💕
"masterpiece....
 robbed her gold medal...
what a shame"
really another Level
Shout out to David Wilson for this incredible choreography.
her gold was stolen by a hack
Russian skaters look how she move her neck and shoulder with music..figure skating isn’t all about jumps..
Only performer that marked a place in my heart. Youre my favorite of them all.
Sochi is a joke. But this performance is just gorgeous.
"My queen, we're robbed this sport"
"Brilliant, beautiful, elegant and outstanding athleticism...thank you, Ms. Kim and BRAVO!"
"The russians ruined this sport. THIS is what it used to be about. Elegance, beauty and amazing technique."
Everytime the Russians fuhhh up I just come back to watch this masterpiece to cross my eyes of what they have seen! :) lolzzz queen forever
She is the one who turned figure skating into art.
Yuna is unmatched. The new quad era is horrible compared to this level of finesse.
The QUEEN. ❤️
pure art! I can’t breathe…
"GIVE HER THE GOLD. The olympics is dirty, no one can trust the result and IOC does nothing about these scandals. Shameful, the Olympics is something I will never enjoy ever again. It is tainted with politics and bias. But Yuna won in the end, her retirement single handedly ended the sport, she beat IOC and ISU. Yall dirty cheaters🙄"
It's a shame that they underscored this performance by around 5 points.
"볼때마다 우는 영상..
선곡도 후배를 위해 
어릿광대를 보내 달라니.."
最高のフィギュアスケーター。
我心中永遠的女神
"So magic, pure perfection from the queen ❤"
김연아 스케이트 타는 거 보면 마음이 편해져요.
"that is exactly why I would love to see more mature women with well conducted, long careers on ice, cause artistry have to develop through the years
you can also see that clearly in 2018 olimpics in zhenya's program, i am not a proffesor in technical stuff, but i know for sure that her artistry was on a different level in comparison to alina, because she is older than alina
I think this discipline would gain so so much from it, this performance is a masterpiece"
Yuna Kim should have got the GOLD... She was Sublime...❤❤❤
"Это же как надо пахать, чтобы довести этот каскад, ритм в каскаде до автоматизма? Ни у одной другой фигуристки не видела такого идеального ритма между прыжками в каскаде! Long live Queen Yuna ❤️"
"美しいプログラム、美しい演技。
ジャンプがどれも良い出来で美しくて、プログラムに溶け込んでる。所作も美しくてスケーティングも良い。
音楽とよく調和してて表現も表情も良い。衣装も美しくて青い会場に映えてる。
好きな演技。"
김연아는 이미 금메달을 가진 여왕 입니다🤗👍👍👍🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
I cann watched this video everyday to have more of a wonderful morning.
"김연아 경기 중 제일 좋아하는 작품!! 노래, 퍼포먼스, 표정 연기, 의상 모두 완벽하다"
This program makes me cry as soon as the music starts. ㅠㅠ
"So graceful, my all time favorite skater ❤"
This is one of the most beautiful things I've seen in my life 😍😱
"Still heartbreaking to see her beautiful program,,, and being robbed gold medal 🏅 shame and terrible scandal ever in Sochi.. But Everybody knows you are the real two time Olympic champion Yuna!"
2021 and still hoping to get an autograph from the legendary ice queen Kim Yuna 🇰🇷 ❤
"It is impossible to describe with words how beautiful her performance is.
Just thanks to yuna for giving us the chance to know how much figure skating can be touching."
the way she skates is so beautiful and enchanting
"This girl makes me cry. No one can hold a candle to her. She is the gold standard in women's figure skating"
다시 봐도 열 받는 대회였습니다. 어떻게 이보다 더 세련되고 우아하게 할 수 있나요? 뱅쿠버때보다 더 능숙합니다.
No quads like the russians  but she is still the best. She is just so emotional when she skates. Each of her steps are like a feather that is floating in the air.
"She won the gold medal..😢
 a fact known to the world"
Congratulations for ur wedding❤️
이 프로그램이랑 아디오스 노니노는 그냥 눈물이 나요 다 그렇잖아요
Two time olympic champion
Impressive final spin combo. Missing the Queen! 😢😢😢
It just makes me cry because I can see that she is trying hard to impress the audience on the last stage of her Olympics. Long live the Queen
"너무나 아름다운 연아의 스케이팅,
기술적으로도 예술적으로도 음악적으로도 완벽한 작품.
얼음 위에서 한마리의 백조가
발레를 하네요. 너무나 선이 아름답고 시냇물이 졸졸 흐르듯 유연하고
성숙한 여인의 향기를 마음껏 뿜어내는
완벽한 발레. 전무후무한, 영원히 기억하고 싶은 명작.👍👍👍👍👍👍"
Ugh just pure perfection
"I can't barely stand on that and she is doing somersaults and flying in mid air I'm so freaking jealous,she is extremely flexible toooooooo"
This is easily could be giving 81 but it was internationally giving 70s wow the help!!!
Why are there 690 people who gave this a thumbs down? I’ll tell you what let me see you do anything remotely close to this… absolutely flawless !
Yuna is flawless
The title is amazing and the performance is breathtaking
この演技を見た時、軽やかで一人だけ違う次元で滑ってるような感覚になりました。感動したのを覚えてます。
So pretty. Am I one of the rare few that loves to hear the sound of the blades on the ice?
What a gracious and perfect performance!
My Olympic champion 2014.
"Beautiful costume, haunting melody, poetry in motion. Pretty much sums up the irony of life."
We were just so pleased to have this beautiful skater and see her mindblowing performance.
곡이 지닌 의미와는 다르지만 어릿 광대를 보내 달라는 제목처럼 그동안 어릿 광대로 살아 온 자신을 이제 편안히 놓아주라는 메시지가 담긴 것 같아서 더 처연하고 아름다웠던 무대 정말 마지막까지 완벽한 피겨 스케이트였다
"Why does my heart move when I see Yuna Kim's skating videos?  Why can't I even feel that way in other people's videos? Her figure skating is perfect and the more you look at it, the more attractive she gets.  I keep seeing videos of her appearing.

한국인이지만 영어로 썼다. 미국사람이 아니라서 문법과 표현문화를 잘 모르기때문에, 어색할지도 모르지만 번역해서 올려본다."
진짜 너무 완벽하다 저렇게 되기까지 얼마나 많이 연습했을까 김연아 선수 당신은 우리의 영원한 챔피언입니다 한국에서 태어나서 피겨 스케이팅의 역사를 세워주셔서 감사합니다~ 아름답게 시작해서 아름답게 끝났네요 정말 대한민국 선수라는 게 너무 자랑스럽습니다 우리한테 이런 감동을 주셔서도 너무 감사해요^^bb
"still feeling like bursting into tears whenever watching this.
Thanks you Yuna"
So beautiful 💛 Still makes me cry.
I love David Wilson's work so much! He is a Maestro for me! ❤
Most beautiful sportswoman in the world...
"私は10~15年前はうつ病が酷くて、キムヨナさんの全盛期のころをよく知らない。
最近昔のフィギュアスケートを見直しているが、
キムヨナさんはほんとに上手いと思う。
昔のフィギュアスケートは前半に必死にジャンプをただ飛んで、後半のステップだけ表現を頑張る選手が多い印象だけど、
キムヨナさんは全体を通してジャンプと表現が上手く融合出来てると思う。
ジャンプもキチンと表現になってるのが凄いなと思う。"
so beautiful，perfect，every moment with the full elegance. She is unpassable.
Mesmerizing.. How i spent my 4.16 mins without blinking my eyes.
흠잡을데 없는 아름다운 연기였네요.  소치이후로 아름답고 감동을 주는 여싱선수 찾기 힘듬. . 화려한 기술은 한번보고 두번보고 싶단 생각이 안드는데 연느는 수십년이 지나고 봐도 계속 감동줄듯.
The real champion.
"watching her again and again.. it is the same feeling i get when i am watching Yuzuru. Both are flowing like water, light.. the jumps are effortlessly done. the king and queen of ice!"
"she was supposed to become a champion .. Anyway, she is a real champion .."
"Watching 2021 🥰..
feels like I'm seeing the wind as she  dance"
"I'm just someone who enjoys looking at these performances. While undoubtedly a great performance, I did not 'feel' this year's Gold medal performance nearly as much as Yuna's performances did."
Best performance ever
Breathtaking one for the ages
What a beautiful performance! it is one of the best programs in the figure history
The only skating program that makes me want to cry. I get goosebumps
뭔가 슬퍼..  개인적으로 이 프로그램이 제일 마음에 저며든다..
Yuna Kim and Michelle Kwan… the greatest to ever take the ice 💕
Her soft knee bend on the landing of 3Flip is so aesthetic to my eyes
"2024년에도 감동이네요😢
어릿광대를 보내주오>아디오스노니노로 마지막 인사하고  치열했던 선수시절을 회고하며 열어본 오르골에서 나오는 음악소리에 춤추는 인형같아요😢  마지막에 해사한 미소까지 김연아는 그냥 존재 자체가 그저 빛이였다…😮"
Stunning! I would watch ice skating again if the performances valued the artistry as much as the athleticism. If the jumps flow with the music that matters more than how big or how many there are.
눈물이나요..너무 아름다워서ㅠㅠ
"I think she has a beautiful well toned body physique… there is no perfect, but I think she has a perfect body to be an ice skater! Beautiful performance. Beautiful choice of music."
The technicals are so flawless …
"Whenever its winter olympics, I would always watch this. This is just so pretty and fun to watch.

Recent competitions are just sad to watch"
Absolutely beautiful! Like a Fairy. Exquisite!
"Such a gorgeous skater. The reason we don't have such skaters anymore is because the push for quads and 3As has forced a huge sacrifice in sustainable technique and artistry. 12 and 13 year olds are now doing dangerous quads, usually with very poor technique. Very intense pressure is being put on their growing bodies, and many girls (especially Russians) are being forced to diet and dehydrate to keep their weight down too, which only makes them more susceptible to injury. They will all be forced to retire too young due to injury, like so many have in recent years. It's heartbreaking to watch the downfall of the sport, and the permanent ruination of so many promising young athletes."
The Queen Yuna Kim is getting married with a beautiful Korean singer❤ We are very happy for her.
Her skating feels... delicious almost. Everything is so smooth
"Annnnnd....the GOLD goes to Yu-Na Kim!!!

THAT was an amazing performance.....technique excellent.....artistry excellent.

Superb portrayal and communication through Send In The Clowns.....the Russian judges.

Would love to have a back-to-back Vancouver-Sochi Yu-Na Kim performance. 

Thank you, Miss Kim.😊👍"
What a beautiful 3 lz with a concrete back outside edge
When is the Olympics going to give her the gold medal she deserves like how they did it for Jamie Sale and David Pelletier after the Russians cheated by paying off the judges? WHEN?!?!?!
No need for a gold medal. Yuna Kim is the gold.
Makes me cry 😭
I always dream a skate duet of yuna kim and yuzuru they r poetry in motion ❤
The world stood still....sweet cute young lady....she will go far and beyond..in her chosen field...
She is light ☀️
There are some great performances that show you the beauty of the movements. And then there are great performances that make you feel the art. This one and Michelle Kwan’s performance to “Fields of Gold” sung by the AMAZING Eva Cassidy are 2 which make you feel the artistry of the movements.
Long live the queen ❤
"speed , technique , softness , musicality , fluid arms"
"썸네일 사진 정말 완벽합니다. 정말 완벽한 아름다움의 순간을 포착했습니다.
김연아의 연기는 10년이 지나도, 매일 보아도 언제나언제나 눈물나게 감동입니다."
"speed , deep edges , soft knee bend all of this Yuna has it all with highest level

Yuna skating skills is off the chart compare to nowaday standard"
Double Olympic champion ❤️
"Her technical excellence, on top of which, her elegance, musicality, femininity, and poise flowing like a fragrant gentle breeze  kissing on your cheeks...still the best of all."
SO lovely.  The athleticism serves the artistic.  She is one with the music.  Makes me think of Peggy fleming.
This might seem trivial in comparison to her skating but I love that color on her. Very few people can wear it.
이게 작품이지 눈물이 날만큼 아련한 감정이 온다고 해야하나 피겨에서 그리움을 주는 작품이라고 생각이 들어요 음악과 삼위일체
Ею восхищаются за нежность и красоту её катания. Ею восхищаются за идеальную технику её прыжков. И самое главное ею восхищаются за её золотое сердце! Любим Королеву. Да здравствует Королева! ❤
"바이올린 선율(클래식)을 무엇보다 빛나게 해주었던..
음악을 가장 섬세한 박까지 쪼개서 쉬는 공간없는 연기를 보여준…김연아님!!
다시봐도 레전드!!"
"지금 다시봐도 최고의 연기 입니다.
감동받고 갑니다."
"Every time I tune in to watch it is always a amazing experience. I appreciate and admire the connection congratulations on your talent and how you are able to keep pleasing your audience or your fans I believe im your biggest “new”, “not so new”, fan."
이 올림픽이 소치올림픽이라서 유감이다. 연느는 세계가 인정하는 피겨 🏆 챔피언이다
"As time passes, this program gets better and better."
The difference is undeniable.
Graceful and beautiful performance!
아직도 볼때마다 울컥한다
"본인이 매력있는걸 아는 사람
그리고 그 매력을 표현할줄 아는 사람
우울해질때면 보러와요
메달이랑 무관하게 제일 좋은 프로그램이였습니다"
"I still can't get over this olympic til now, How could Adelina got same score like this masterpiece of Yuna Kim? 🙄 What a joke!"
Yuna is an ice goddess ❤❤
when I see this program Im crying everyday..
이건 스포츠가 아니라 그냥 예술작품임ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Everything is beautiful❤️
Still watching in 2024
Wow! This moved me to tears. Exquisite.
I love her performance .....
Wow so beautifully skated!
Miss you Queen. Especially this time of the year...
"음악이 멈추고 숨이 쉬어짐.
너무 감동해서 눈물이나네요.
아름답다"
BELLISSIMA YUNA!!!!  BELLO ESPETÁCULO!!!! GRAZIE!!!!!
어찌 눈물이 안 나겠어요 너무 장합니다😊
surely her second Olympic Gold Medals....
Yuna is the real Gold
Very nice! I remember her in your younger teen years. Very polished performance. Wow. Simply amazing!
Just beautiful skating. Perfection.
퀸연아 만큼 우아하고 감동적인 스케이터를 본적이 없다😭넘 보고싶어요 다시 이런 선수를 볼수있을런지
The Queen is here.
Beautiful and ethereal. This is art.
"Thank you, Yuna Kim! You are the real champion of all!"
"이 경기의 내 가슴속 진정한 금메달 리스트는 오직 김연아 뿐이다
이에 대해선 전 세계 그 어느 누구도 반박할 수 없을 것이다"
"Human perfection <3 I still remember being so amazed by her, enchanted, dumbfounded
...fast forward 9yrs and people consider pole dancing ""art"" :'("
바람에 휘청이는 연기 진짜 예술임... 이 작품은 볼 때마다 눈물나.. 2:50 ~ 2:57 여기는 요정 같아...
아직도 여전히 제일 아름다운 피겨선수
Always a Queen
"SP: 80 (more than)
FP: 150 (more than)"
This is my 2nd most favorite of Yuna.  The 1st is Les Miserables.
So wonderful !!!!!!!!!!!!!
왜 눈물이 나지?
"Вот что-то в ней такое есть, что пересматриваю снова и снова. Другие могут прыгать четверные , но при этом такого эффекта не вызывают"
"또보고,또봐도 차원이다르다"
"외국인들 댓글들이 하나같이 감동이네
굳이 한국인들이 국뽕 선동 안해도
해외 팬들이 알아서 성토해 준다
영어로 안 쓰고 걍 주시만 할란다
김연아는 벤쿠버, 소치 2연속 챔피언이 맞다"
1:37 연습에서 잘 안됐던 플립 점프 성공하고 활짝 웃는 장면이 아쉽게도 올림픽채널에는 안잡혔군요
레미제라블이랑 이 경기만 보면 이상하게 꼭 눈물이 나ㅜㅜ
She should have win.
마음 아파서 마지막 올림픽 두 작품은 처음부터 끝까지 본 적이 없어요.ㅜㅜ
다시봐도 정말 대단하다. 연아를 능가하는 선수는 앞으로도 없을것같은 느낌!   🎉
"Perfect 🤩 (Flip) jump with textbook jump
But 1 stupid judge gave her 0 GOE 🤡🤡🤡 and most other judges gave her only +1 GOE
Her step sequence must got max level 4
Her short program must received 80 points, free skate > 146 points then she won 🥇🥇
She really proved that ISU are clowns 🤡 that’s why she chose Send in the Clowns 🤡 as her last short program was so correct"
Yuna said send in the clowns and ISU took her literally
Two time gold medalist no matter what
OMG SHE DID AMAZING!!
"Another very great, beautiful performance."
She's so incridible 😮
IOC u guys dont even deserve this beautiful athletes. Get gold back to yuna
Everything she did was light years ahead of Sotnikova.
IT'S 2024 AND WE STILL WANT JUSTICE FOR YUNA KIM!!!
02:50 여기부터 너무 좋음🥹🥹🥹 진짜 예술성의 극치
솔직히 예전엔 연아님이 잘하는건 알아도 얼마나 특출나게 잘한다는건지 잘 몰랐었어요 근데 요즘 스케이터들 연기를보고 다시 연아님 영상을보니 아~이래서 연느님 연느님하는거였구나를 제대로 느끼게 되었어요~일단 시작부터  흡인력이 대단하고 연기를 보면서 가슴아래에서 뭔가가 스물스물 차오르면서 이내 가슴이 벅차오르고 너무 아름다워 눈물이 저절로 흐르고 있는 저를 봤어요~오 마이 갓~~!!!  우리의 보물♡♡연아님 너무 너무 사랑하고 감사합니다
やっぱり綺麗✨
"Luna kim ,is the real Pole Star  on   Earth. So charming, Long Live.from ,Manipur ,India"
Always love this performance❤
"For 4 minutes, suddenly the world feels better when she starts skating."
"개인적으로 아디오스 노니뇨보다 이 곡이 더 좋네. 은퇴해서 돌아오고 이런 수준높은 연기력, 유려한 스케이팅, 수준높은 기술들까지... 신혜숙코치가 왜 피겨를 더 해줬으면...했는지 조금은 알 것 같다."
She was SO robbed! Shame! She goes down as one of the greatest of all time. There are not many but she IS!
So graceful!
Gorgeous 💛
Flawless fluidity 💛💚
"그녀의 피겨는 무언가 영적이야. 감정을 동요시킨다고나 할까... 현재 피겨계에 특출한 선수들이 많이 나왔지만, 아직도 내겐 김연아 선수가  독보적이다."
시간이 지나도 김연아 예술성 뛰어넘는 선수는 아직 없는것 같아요 지금봐도 단연코 최고예요
3:04 단순하게  후진하는 안무를 이렇게 사랑스럽고 우아하게 그려내다니.
"이유는 모르겠는데
자꾸 눈물이 나네요
이런게 감동이라는거겠죠"
A true legend
Queen Yuna 👑
"Flawless, very beautiful"
So beautiful
every element at its finest
Extremely beautiful!!!🤩😍😍❤
요즘계속 연아선수의 피겨 경기들을 찾아보게되네요ㅜㅜ 너무 아름다워요
Queen of Yuna.
"너무너무멋져요
영원한감동입니다"
"Me encanta, cada vez que aprecio este video, redescubro la belleza en esta manifestación."
Queen yuna!!!!!!!!
"제가 이 아름다운 연기를 보기 위해 태어났군요. 예술의 극치일 뿐만 아니라, 기술적인 면에서도 점프에서 착지까지의 비거리가 대단합니다."
キムヨナさんとても美しいですね。この衣装もとても似合っていて、更に演技を引き立てています。ソチ五輪でも輝きを放っていました、素敵です💜
"김연아 선수의 올림픽 쇼트 프로그램은 007이 매력적이지만, 개인적으로는 어릿광대도 참 좋아합니다. 그런데 이 숨이 멎을 정도로 아름다운 연기의 조회수가 많이 높지는 않네요. 

아마도 연아 선수의 소치 올림픽 롱 프로그램은 2014년 2월에, 그리고 이 쇼트 프로그램은 2019년 9월에 뒤늦게 업로드되었기 때문일 겁니다. 007은 2016년 2월에 업로드되었습니다.

이 동영상을 좋아하신다면 공유해주시기 바랍니다. 감사합니다."
몸짓 하나하나 어쩜 이리 아름다울까! 피겨의 전설!!
I can't let you go😭😭 still now.
beautiful...
Just beautiful
이 영상이 그리워 다시 보러 왔습니다
miss her so much！！
"보면 볼수록 아름다운 연기, 예술입니다. 늘 아름다움의 극치를 보여주는 김연아에게 아직도 존경의 마음을 금할 수 없습니다.^&^"
THIS is figureskating!!!
She and Yuzuru in my eyes are the Queen and King of ice.. It is clearly visible these naturally gifted talents skate with love where as the others just for medals etc.. Just my opinion...
So beautiful.
"쿼드점프도 하고 기술적으로 뛰어난 선수들 많지만. 아무리 많은 경기를 봐도
김연아선수와 같은 선수는 없다.
그녀는 완벽한점프를 했고
스포츠를 예술로 승화시켰고
그녀의 피겨는 격조가있고 기품이 있다."
the elegance is like no other
My Queen
지금도 봐요 내몸에 살포시 내려앉는 나비? 내손위에 살포시 내린 눈?  하늘하늘 내려오는 깃털? 그느낌인데 참 가슴이 아리네
2014年から11年が経ち彼女があまり評判が良くなかったこの衣装を選んだ理由がフランクシナトラの歌、そして歌詞を聴いてよくわかりました。彼女は本当に聡明ですべてが美しい大好きなスケーターでした✨
The real GOAT !!
So beautiful 💛
The real queen!
So beautiful!
Here to honor the true 2014 Gold Medalist.
Beautiful skating and program to revisit…
"그어떤 칭찬도. 감동 또 감동
천사 가 내려와서 잠깐 노니는듯. 눈물 납니다❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
QUEEN YUNA
"long live the queen 
여왕폐하..
send in clawn 자신의 후배를 위한 마음으로...  선곡 했넌... 김연아의 은퇴는 지금다시 봐도 눈물이 나네요"
No one is more magnificent.
"Сделай Юна каскад тулуп-тулуп в короткой, как Аделина, ей бы от силы 68 баллов поставили бы думаю (На ЧМ 2013 ей с таким же контентом как в Сочи поставили меньше 70). А по вращениям, дорогие мои, общая разница за обе программы у них была лишь 0.3. Как бы вы не хотели это признавать, нечестное судейство  было в Сочи"
"슬퍼 ,,,,연아 보고싶다"
She like butterfly
She's a natural
"Although deceiving themselves, the fact is that both Sotonikova and the Russian Ice Federation will definitely know the true medal master.
벤쿠버 때의 완벽함에 여유가 더해져서 소치에서의 프리도 쇼트도 정말 아름답고 전설로 남을 만한 무대였다고 생각하는데, 메달을 도둑맞은 것이 마음이 아파서 경기 영상을 자주 못 보겠다.
소트니코바, 러시아 빙상 연맹 부디 모두 죄값 치르고 벌받아라^^🙏🙏
 The medal belongs to the Queen🥇"
本当に素晴らしい！キム・ヨナが女王🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹本当の金メダルはキム・ヨナ
정말 보는 내내 소름이..아름답다ㅠㅠ
Amazing Yuna kim
"지금 다시봐도 너무 가슴이 아려오는 연기. 
저 부드러운 몸짓과 깃털같지만 정확한 점프."
So beautiful.
영원한 여왕 김연아선수님^^ 👸 💗 💕
경이로울만큼 아름답다..
"😲😱😲OMG ,SHE IS AMAZING 👏"
"너무 아름다운 프로그램, 특히 스텝 부분이 너무너무 좋아서 볼때마다 뭉클함"
이게 벌써 십년전이라니~~ 아직도 내 심장뛰는  생생한 그녀의 연기..저 때 의상 단무지 같다는 쓴소리도 많았는데.. 의상이 뭐가 중요함. 난 이것도 너무 예쁘기만 하더라..
정말 아름다웠던 프로그램...간단히 말해 쉽다. 다른 선수들에게 김연아 안무 그대로 해보라고 하고 김연아 선수에게 다른 선수들의 안무를 해 보라고 하면 답이 나온다. 그들은 김연아 선수 경기를 뛰어넘을 수 없겟지만 아마 김연아는 훨씬 더 멋들어지게 그들의 안무 경기를 뛰어넘는 작품으로 나올 것. 흉내낼 수 없는 오리지널리티와 아우라 그리고 높은 퀄리티의 기술
왜 영상을 새로 올려서 조회수를 적게보이도록 하는지 알 수가 없다.
Beautiful!
Best female figure skater of all time 🤍🏆
지금 다시 봐도 너무 아름답다…
진짜 잘탄다..💛 소치는 마음아파서 잘 못보지만 너무 아름다운 프로그램이였어ㅠㅠ
Love Yuna Kim
i wish i could watch this for the first time again
"Қараңыздар, мұз қатты, иә? Конькидің жүзі де қатты. Бірақ Ёна патшайымның сырғанауы неге сондай жұмсақ? Феномен! 👸"
ten yrs later....still thinking about how she deserved it all
The dress is  gorgeous 😍
Queen Yuna
"어쩜 이리도 우아하고 아름다울 수 있을까? 정말 이 4분의 연기가 온 세계인들을 숨죽이고 보게 만드는군요
~~~~"
앞으로도 전에도 이런 스케이터는 없을거예요~ 정말 최고입니다!!
i love her sm she is an absolute goddess kinda off topic but after watching this the dirt in my toes all dissapearead XD
"thanks Yuna, u made me like this sport/art"
Flawless beauty grace and precision! Gold !
"부담갖지마~연아야~
너의 눈물도 뜨겁게 안을 수 있는
사람이 나! 😊
감동이야.
우리 연아는 훌륭하고 예뻐♡
쓰러지지 않게 컨디션조절 잘해~
그럼 👋바이~"
힘들 때면 샌딘과 온리홉을 봐요. 그러면 힘듦이 조금 덜해져요. 퀸연아.... 늘 행복하세요 ❤
"아름답고
우아하고
앞으로도
김연아 같은 선수는 나오기
힘들지."
내가 제일 좋아하는 무대…….. 💛💛봐도봐도 감동적이다
A truly gift.
동화속 요정이 은반위에서 있는거같다. 이게 현실인가 의심될 정도로 너무 아름답다.
An angel….
A butterfly on the ice 🦋
A SUPERB PERFORMANCE...but unfair WORLD
"Молодец, Юна!  Красивое выступление!"
감상하게 되는 연기.
노래곡이랑 안무가 조화를 이루니 왜리 슬퍼서 눈물이나냐
지금에 와서 봐도 역시나 여왕님이 십니다!!!❤❤❤❤❤
perfection❤ long live the queen
Great Yuna Kim
"If her performance was so breathtaking, why was she robbed of the gold ??? 😭😭😭"
so graceful 🌟🌟
"Какая умничка, все движения очень красивые, приятно смотреть такое выступление"
2024년에도 봐요
Queen Yuna
Still salty about her stolen gold medal 🥇 long live the queen!
보면볼수록 우아하고 아름답다. 기교를 배제한 진짜 아티스트의 작품.
Конечно украли золото она была великолепна
Long Live The Queen
So beautiful ❤
We are now facing once again the kind of a robbery that IOC lets happen to figure skaters with regular doping Russian skaters take to cheat.
비교가 불가능한 위대한 예술가. 피겨스케이팅을 예술의 경지에 이르게 한 김연아선수에게 경의를 보냅니다.
그녀가 떠났어도 항상 그녀가 아직까지 빙판에 존재하는 듯. 김연아 선수가 은퇴하고 아직까지 김연아 선수같은 스케이터는 없는 듯
Queen Yuna
3:05 김연아가 스텝도 잘한다는거 여기서 바로 보임
You are amazing ! So beautiful & gorgeous  !.
"매번 아찔하게 멋진 울 연아님
4~5회전 보다 높이 점프하고 날아가 사뿐히 얼음판에 내려 앉은 스핀도 슬로우로 봐도 엄청 빨라요~~♡
넘 예쁘고 자랑스럽네여~~💜❤"
I wished there would be two gold medals awarded...as it is possible in other sports - one of the most beautiful moments of Tokyo games 2020 was Barshim sharing gold with Tamberi.
기술이 완벽한 예술로 표현되는 연아의 마법💙
Fantastic
가끔씩 다시 보지만  볼수록  아름답고 놀랍습니다  역시 김연아는  최고  피겨 여왕 입니다  감동적이예요  ~~
"제일 사랑하는 프로그램
정말 식상한 표현이지만 꽃보다 아름답다 정말 진심으로"
볼때마다 눈물이 나오는 아름다운 프로그램…..
I've never seen anything so beautiful!!!@.@!!~♡♡♡
Fantastic performance🎇
너무 아름다워요. 최고.  ❤❤❤❤❤
연아야!!! 정말 최고다^^♡♡♡
溢れる才能と美しさ！
나는 아직도 마음이 아파 못보겠다 연아는 최고의 경기를 하였음에도 러시아 아델리나 소트리코바에게 빼앗긴 금메달만 생각하면:.이 영상의 조회수가 낮은 이유는 많은 한국인들이 나와 같은 마음 아닐까
2:34 너무너무 평화로운 미소까지…천국을 엿본 느낌. 숭고한 아름다움❤ 2:53 3:03
그저 존경과 눈물
"Well, definitely one of the best SP!!!"
Real queen!!!
언제봐도 레전드.. 멋있음
Hail to the lovely Queen!!
They didn't upload Sotnikova's short program&Gala show... She was a gold medalist... But why didn't they upload both????
YUNA KIM ERAS LA MEJOR DE LAS MEJORES SOLO TU LOSABES Y TU CORAZON
또보고 또봐도 이쁜연아 스케이팅에 천재다 👍 👍 👍
Os olhos não acreditam no espetáculo que está ai. Lindo!
QUEEN 👑
Simply magnificent!
You can have that cheated gold... but everyone knows who the real Queen is... Miss you Queen yuna..
그냥 완벽
엣지 쓰는거랑 궤적 그리는것만 봐도 힐링이 되네..여왕님 사랑합니다❤
Flawless
Stunned
so beautiful 💛
"요즘 피겨선수들은 기술은 좋은데 연아만큼 감동이 없는거 같아서 아쉬움 ㅜㅜ  그시절엔 그저 김연아가 잘하는줄 알았는데, 지금 와서 보니 정말 대단대단 엄청난 역사를 쓴 위대한 선수였음을....."
She is my gold medalist 😤😤
이것만 보면 가슴이 찢어진다 ㅠㅠ 얼마나 마음고생이 심했을지 ㅠㅠ 정말 대단하고 또 대단하다
"Give her the Gold already, you bloody thief!!"
Wow1 That was like magic...
我永遠最喜歡的選手
She owns that year
2024년 출첵
Kim is still memorable the winner is forgotten!
yuna Queen
So beautiful
omg! this is just like yuri on ice!!! i didnt know they made it into a real sport!
우리 위대한 대한민국 최고의 슈퍼스타왕 미스 연아님은 매일에 건강하시고 행복하시길 기원합니다!
"소치가 수치스러운 올림픽이다.
이 아름다운 작품에 도대체 무슨짓을 한건지. . ."
Beautiful
"조회수가 겨우249만이라니...
위대한 스케이터 김연아....
피겨여왕의 자태를 보라
이 여인은 유일무이하다..."
"다시봐도 너무 아름답네요
진정한 피겨여왕이세요~"
She is a text book. And queen.
"When Russians do circus after taking drugs, Yuna performs art."
일필휘지!! 딱 이 퍼포먼스를 위한 단어라고 생각합니다
경이롭다!!! 연느♡ 넘사벽이네 빙판이 아닌 물인줄 착각하게 만드는 그녀 걍 다른레벨 비교대상이 없네 아직까지도~~
Perfect
The absolute clownery of the judges for not giving this a gold medal
뭉클하다. 연아선수가 최고야 💜
"Yuna Kim: Send in the clowns
Sochi judges: allow us to introduce ourselves"
"people keep saying Kamila Valieva is the best skater ever, but I beg to differ..."
2022?
Elegance
지금 보니 드레스도 아름답고 프로그램도 너무 물 흐르듯이 완벽하네
Beautiful.  Like a swan.
난 이프로그램이 젤 좋드라..몇년이 지나도 다시 찾아봐..
Her program is a MASTERPIECE🤍
몇번을 봐도 감동적인 연기..
"어릿광대를 진심으로 그리워하는것 같은 예술적인 표현, 잔잔한 음악, 연느님의 아름다운 연기가 제 마음을 다독여줘요 너무 행복해요"
김연아의 어릿광대를보내주오.  하염없이 흘러내리는 빗물마냥  내마음에도 그 하염없는 빗물이..
This is real figure
"너무예쁜김연아
그녀가있어 참 행복했어요"
💗10th Anniversary💗
10 years later and i still cant get over the absolute blatant robbery in sochi
Yuna 😍
연아의 마지막 시즌은 아직도 눈시울이 붉어진다.....
Bravo. Perfect
김연아의 금메달을 도둑맞은 올림픽
연아만이 가능하다  언제나 깊은 감동과 울림을 주는 연기~힘들때마다 연아보고 용기를 얻는다
1:07 soooo beautiful ✨
다시봐도~ 언제봐도~ 아름답고 우아하다😊
Send in the clowns AKA the corrupt Russians who ROBBED her of this medal
Queen ⭐️
"if i was an alien, and this performance by yuna was all i saw, i'd have respect humanity"
Queen
아름다운 봄을 보았어요 ~ 💕💕
"2:36소치프리

 내가사랑하는 탱고 아디오스노니노"
3:10 he seems happy to be on camera
"연아 !  당신과 동시대에 살다간 나는 정말 행운아 입니다.
사랑합니다."
Kim yuna  Park so youn really great❤ is like a twin sister WOW
She's floating
she is last actress on ice......so depressed
Perfection!
Very perfect ice dance.
Oh my Queen ❤
this is art
김연아 최고 👍 😍
Yunaaa 💛
she was not kidding when she said send in the clowns lmao
너무 완벽해서 놀람....ㅎㅎㅎ
보고 또 보아도 참으로 매력적이고 아름다운 이야기의 놀라운 표현입니다.
"나비의 날개같고.
새의 깃털같이 부드럽고 아름다운. 저 고운 스케이터가 너무 예쁩니다.
너무 아름답습니다."
she TOTALLY was robbed the gold
힘들때마다 위로가된다
"연아는 감동입니다
❤❤❤"
gold medal
Beautiful 💛
"Shame on Sochi Olympic ,  Yuna Kim is Gold medal not Russian Sotnikova who was missing tempo and ability."
Very nice.
사뿐사뿐 나비 한마리가 춤을 추는것 같네요~🌼🦋
이 스텝이 3레벨이고 소트니 개년 스텝이 4레벨이라는게 놀랍다
너무 완벽하다. 여왕님!!
이때 정말 억까하는 인간들이 주니어 선수처럼 노란옷 입고 나왔다고 격렬하게 까던게 기억난다. 이렇게 아름다운데.
One of the greatest. I hate comparing skaters or showing hatred. Try to remember people there is more to life than gold and those other skaters including Russian are someone’s child. Peace.
최애 프로그램이에요 ㅠ
어쩐지 슬프고 아련함이 남는 연기.. 마지막 쇼트 프로그램.
진정한 금메달은 김연아 당신입니다.
"너무 아름다운 김연아 연기~
개인적으로 이 연기가 가장 좋음~~"
진짜 감동적이다 ❤
Long live the Queen.
"너무 애잔하다~~

소트니 불나방 금메달 내놔~!!!!"
정말이지 이건 예술이다♡
Love this soooooooo much
荒川静香と同じで腕の使い方がしなやかで綺麗だから、ヒラヒラした袖が映えてて良い。
최고중에 최고 연아님♡
"Figure skating MUST restore integrity to the sport and STOP rewarding dangerous, potentially life-altering athletic moves over the storytelling and emotional depth the sport was built on!"
Determination ❤
This should of been enough for her to win overall (even if AS got the FS) in my opinion…. The SP scores were too close….
Goat
堂々として美しくて好きでした。
"The way russia robbed yuna. Anyways, Yuna is still the best female skater in the world and she's getting love from us. Russia can't relate"
김연아 선수 정말 잘하시네요 ㅋㅋㅋ😋🥰❤
"백년후에나,
나오려나.
이토록 아름다운 스케이트가~~,,,♡"
"역시,
여왕 연아!👍👍👍👍👍"
어릿광대는 안무가 기가막히게 우아해
I cried at 3:30
나 또왔어 유나킴....영원한 피겨퀸 보고싶다ㅠㅠ
2:10 점프하고 포징하고 씨익 웃는 거...❤️
완벽한 하나의 작품. 점수의 의미가 없음.
숨이 막힌다는것이 이런거죠~
She's truly goddess 💓💓
Insuperável! 😍
she really predicted it when she danced to send in the clowns
got gosebumps
2:45 ❤
너무 아름답다..
Love
My lolmodel …. So pretty and ice queen❤️❤️❤️
"연아양의 진짜 안타까움 프로그램
이예요."
"Одно могу сказать, что катание Сотниковой ничто по сравнению с лебединой песней Юны Ким: плавность  линий чувственность забыть невозможно!!!"
우아함의 극치😊
History’s never seen anyone quite like HER.
Особенно люблю её финальное вращение именно здесь!
수십번을 보지만 너무나 아름답다
This was not Gold but Palladium Metal (higher than Gold) performance
I miss when figure skating had substance
기술도 뛰어나지만 연아는 서양인을 능가할만큼 아름다운 몸을 갖고있음..
진짜 이 경기 클린한거 리스펙함
Perfect
소치의 진짜 주인공
연아선수는 회전할때 다른 사람보다 회전속도가 느린 느낌이예요 그만큼 더 높이 더 멀리 뛰어서 그런거겠죠~🥰👍 소치올림픽 금메달의 주인공은 김연아선수입니다~🎖👍
so gorgeous
綺麗な演技ですね。氷上の女王と言えるのはキムヨナだけです💜
GOAT
"Her face resembles Seulgi from RV a little bit, what a performance 💖💖"
8년이 흘러서 그런지 더 아련하다
김연아  언제봐도 흐뭇하구만
She looked a bit like tzuyu....btw her dance was just amazing😌💜👍🏻💓
The best ever!
Wow  ...gorgeous
GORGEOUS
"마지막이라서 그런지 더 슬프게 느껴진다 이때도 도핑 의혹 있었는데 ㅠㅠ 
러시아는 금메달 다시 내놔라"
이렇게 완벽할 수가 연느 대단하다~~^^♡
연아 양은 본인의 별명들을 다 낯간지럽다고 여기지만 도무지 여왕이라고 하지 않곤 못 배기겠다 ㅜㅜ
"When I heard the name of the song, I thought it was going to be boisterous and carnival-like. Imagine my surprise when it's more on the level of Moonlight Sonata"
_Queen✨_
Sempurna
I watch her to be healed...
"I miss her, Carolina, Mao Asada and a few others. Now we have jumping machine, nearly anorexic children. No art, no carisma"
2:52 내가 제일 좋아하는 뒷짐?지는 안무 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그냥 너무 좋음 ㅋㅋㅋ 거쉰에서도 스윗살코를 좋아함
심란할 때 연아를 찾아봅니다. 큰 위안이 됩니다. 아마도 이 위안은 언제까지나 유효할 것 같습니다. 전세계인은 김연아에게 고마워해야 하겠죠. 연아가 동시대에 존재해줌을.
저렇게 열심히 마지막 올림픽을 위해 준비했는데 심사위원들은 금메달을 정해놓고 형식적인 숫자놀이만 하고있었을 생각하니까 참.... 공산당의 올림픽은 비리만 가득한 동네 체육대회 수준이네 쯧..
Sudah 2 th aku kehilangan. Aku terasa kesepian. KINI AKU telah mendapatkan. Mendaoatkan mbak yuna kim's kembali. Muksin. Indonesia SALAM kim yuna
Perfect!!!
ISU choosing judges for Sochi: Send in the clowns🤡
Jaw dropping 🎉
"심판들아 보고있나?
연아의 이 위대한 작품이 74점 이라는게  말이되냐?
심판이름을한 날강도들 같으니라구!"
"샌딘 너무도 사랑하는 프로그램임.
 사무치게 그리운 느낌 ㅠㅠ"
Wow ✨
너무너무나 아름답다 ❤❤❤❤❤
love 01:07.
I LOVE YOU FOREVER
온몸에 전율이 흐르게 하는 피겨여왕 연아 퀸
Love you vena kim
죽음의 무도랑 이 프로그램은 아직도 끊을 수가 없어요. 마약과도 같은..ㅎㅎ
아름다운 연기
Yuna Kim is legenda no russia
The IOC is greedy mofos. First they robbed her gold metal and they are trying to capitalise from her performance. Shame on you.
❤️❤️❤️
너무 머싯서🍣잘한다 김연아😀
Humans can do anything they want.
물이 흐르듯 자연스러운 연기...누구도 따라 할 수없음. 그걸 이해 못하는 나라는 러샤뿐.
Simply perfect. And lovely.😊😊
김연아선수 사랑해요 ❤❤❤
어릿광대를 본인으로 표현한게 아니였을까요 ㅠㅠ 국민들의 어릿광대로 살아온 본인을 보내달라는걸로 보여서 이 영상은 뭔가 짠해요 ㅠㅠ 어린소녀가 감당했을 부담감이랄까… 앞으로 이런 선수는 없을거같아요 😢
GOAT
Super 👍👍👍
사랑해 연아야❤

"Kim love it

whos that winner? dont know her

러시아는 약물과 조작 아니면 공정한 승부를 볼수 없나? 22년 베이징 올림픽 에서도 약물로 그 어린 선수들에게 몹쓸짓을 하는군..내가 정말 김연아를 뛰어넘고 싶은 소트니코바였다면 기쁨이 아니라.. 조작으로 훔쳐온 금메달을 보고 수치스러웠을것!
👏👏🌟
우와 세상에 ........... 천사다
Only in the SPshe was at least 5pts better than Kostner and Kostner was 3pts ahead of anyone else but Yuna. Sigh! This was probably the worst judging injustice in figure skating ever.
And meanwhile I fall over trying to step onto the ice rink
진짜 아름답다
Most beautiful woman
너무 아름답다
🌹🌹🌹🌹퀸연아 사랑해요 🌺🌻💐🐝🌴🏵🍀

"80점 나왔어야했던 쇼트프로그램 .. 
러시아는 부끄러운줄 알아야함"
The judges are the clown..heartless clown. Give her back Sochi with full respect.
👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋
Woooooo
사랑은 꿈과 같은것
Bellissima
'Send in the clowns' what? Was she referring to the judges?
이거보면 요새 피겨는 가산점을 너무 남발한다고 느낀다
Que apresentação mais linda!!!!!
이 무대를 상대로 금메달을 뺏어갈 것이었으면 발전이라도 하던가 최소한 기술이라도 앞섰던가 약을 써도 그 모양 그 꼴이었던 무대에 너무 어이없게 뺏겼던게 진짜 언제 생각해도 너무 속상하다
Beutiful
너무 유려하다 수영을 하는듯 물위를 그리는듯 아름답고 부드러우면서도 힘있고 예술입니다.
What pivot/element does she do at 2:55 and spin at 3:19 after the bullet?
우아하고 기품있는데 눈물남 ㅜㅠ
오 나의 여왕님
😍😍😍
너무 아름답다 ㅜㅜ
en año 2022 necesito music monday patin sobre hielo
"Genuine question: to the Russians here, do you think she deserved silver? (again, I am very curious what does the average Russian think)"
이 아름답다못해 경이롭기까지한 피겨선수에게 소치올림픽은 무슨 짓을 한겁니까.. 오랜 시간이 지나도 러시아의 부끄러움이 되겠지요.
감동~♡
How she didn't win is a travesty.
연아는 현재 결혼해서 잘살고 있어요 ㅎㅎ
Russia since this embarassment has created many mini Yuna Kim... Eteri knew exactly what she was doing getting these girls with about Yuna's build. Kind of disgusting if you ask me.

역시김연아 야
나는 이때 금메달을 당연히 한국이 가져갈줄 알았어 하지만 금메달을 도둑맞았어
"Аделинаның каскады 3 toeloop-3 toeloop. Ёнаның каскады 3 лутц-3 toeloop. Бірақ екеуінің ұпай айырмашылығы 0.28. Неге? Компонент бойынша екеуінің ұпайы бірдей. Неге? Біраз атақ-даңқы болса мейлі ғой, бірақ ол Еуропа чемпионатын да жеңбеген ғой, екі күмісі ғана болған."
does anyone know where I can find this specific version of the song?
Sochi is the most terrible Olympics in figure skating. this performance keeps proving injustice of the scores.
연아님잠깔힐링하러왔어요..
"Isu, shame on you"
The clowns aka the ISU judges in this competition who scored Adelina higher than Yuna.
She retired after this Olympics💐🩷
the nerve after you cheated her out of gold with cheated jumps and inflated scores
나비보다 더나풀나풀 가볍고우아해
약먹고 서커스하는 러시아 선수들과는 급이 다르다
2014년 경기인데 업로드 된 날짜는 왜 이래?
0:43
❤
You Tube 동영상이 워낙 많아서 김연아도 자신의 동영상을 다 보지는 못할 듯.
스텝 때문에 계속 돌려봄
소트니하고는  비교가  안된다.
"That is the ""figure skate"""
👑👏👏👏
so tonya harding and yuna kim both skated to send in the clowns?
Anybody know what is the artist of this song?
👍👍👍👍
figure skating is not a sport that compete jumping.
"I mean, some clownery did happen in this competition"
진짜 몰입하게한다. 숨쉬듯 타는 스케이트
"the figure skating judges are terrible, if the sport sinks it will be their fault, they made the spectators believe that the best skaters are the ones with bad technical execution."
"Have the guts to upload this and pretend nothing was wrong in Sochi, 2014. What a joke. So political and greedy capitalizing off this performance. Shame on you IOC."
ニュース見てびっくりしたんだけど❗️
나 이거 또봐ㅜㅜ
"항상건강하서요
지금도건강하겠지만요"

one day karma will reach the judges of Sochi 2014
Was there a bit too much actual time  on ice before she started?
👍💖
좋아요
Soy yo o no estuvo al 100% en los giros????
구름위를 노니는 것 같다.
"this program was underscored so that adelina could take the lead lol what a joke, Kim got 0 GoE for certain jumps"
YAS the judges are clowns 🤡
요즘 피겨는 점프  회전수 높이느라 이나바워 대충들 해서 안 이쁘더라.  채점기준이  피겨 망쳤다. 러시아 애들은 팔동작이 전부 벨리댄서 같고.
Robbed.
more like a dancer. don’t feel the skates till jumps.
스케이트 속도가 엄청나네요 허걱
All those judges should be banned.

러시아도 중국과 별반 다르지 않은 민족성을 보이지 아무리 친러시아 밀고 나가도 그들의 외국인 핍밥과 테러는 불과 몇년전까지만해도 전통적으로 행해적던 야만적인 나라라는건 변함이 없다
she was robbed
Yuna prolly chose this piece of music because... yk... clowns...
Jitna bhi kahe kam hai super performance

"Да, не упади Юля Липницкая  в короткой, она бы легко и с лихвой, обыграла Юну. Потому что у Юли и программа интереснее, и прыжки легче. Не исключено, что Юну обошли бы и Аделина, с  Мао, откатайся она  без грубых ошибок. Возможно, Юна осталась бы без медали вообще."
あんまりだわ。

"She is an elegant skater, everything is very clean and well executed, but I can't help but feel that her choreography and overall performance is just too basic for my taste. She's a great jumper, that's for sure. But for the rest of it, I think the Russians are unmatched in ice dancing, creativity, expressivity, the speed and difficulty of their spins, the wide moves, the perfect combination of athleticism and grace. I've just enjoyed watching Russian figure skaters ever since I can remember and keep being their fan. Too bad for this doping scandal, it really is a shame."
