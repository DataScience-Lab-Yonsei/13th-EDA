What was your favorite Olympic performance to music? Let us know in the comments and we will add them to a future #MusicMonday!
If you’re ever sad remember you live on the same world as YUZURU HANYU
"what's more beautiful than chopin's ballade no 1? 

chopin's ballade no 1 WITH yuzuru hanyu on ice."
I don’t know a lot about this sport/art honestly I don’t even know what I’m doing here.. but this was magical I loved it
フィギュアスケート史上最高のショートプログラムだと思います。現在も未来も越えることはないでしょう。
Never forget that he skated with a still busted ankle. Yuzuru is the G.O.A.T
"THIS WAS SUCH A CLEAN SKATE, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THIS DIDN'T EARN HIM A WR"
"He plants his toepick into the ice to the precise beat of piano notes being played.  That quad toe triple toe was...  out of this world. To those who witnessed it live... it must have been a miracle. 

Anyone watching this programme for first time would not have seen that triple Axel coming. Takes off with pinpoint precision to the music. Welcome to Planet Hanyu indeed... Population: 1. Him."
"見る度に感動が深まります。
羽生結弦の名はスケートとかスポーツの範囲を超えて偉人として歴史に刻まれる。生きて羽生結弦を見られることはこの時代に生まれ合わせた奇跡しかない。悠久の時の流れから見たら瞬きひとつタイミングがずれてたら目にすることが出来なかった訳だから。神の祝福の何ものでもでもない。神様ありがとうございます！"
"2:40 he isn't just performing, he is _seriously_ actually dancing, giving emotion to the piece. It's beautiful."
i am not saying he was robbed and deserved a WR but thats exactly what i'm saying
"I have to say everything is perfect. The music, the costume, the audience and of course his mesmerizing and aesthetic performance. The champion!!"
"I know nothing about figure skating, but Hanyu looks like an angel."
His score still pissed me off tho. He deserves the new world record with this performance
I don't watch skating but he's incredibly talented and mesmerizing. He's not just beautiful and smooth on the ice. He's confident. He looks like he ows the ice. I love watching him.
Yuzuru Hanyu has raised my standards for good skating like I cant watch anyone else because they all look so heavy compared to him. He just makes it look so effortless its amazing
"怪我をしていたのにぶっつけ本番の演技、この時、金メダルを獲る奇跡が起こると確信したバラード1番。正座して祈りながらTVを観ていた。手がいたくなるの程拍手した想い出。
そして、今日、羽生結弦選手のEchoes広島公演初日でまた、バラード1番が 観れる幸せを頂きありがとうございます。"
How could anyone pull off a perfect program on an injured ankle and under immense pressure? I'm so happy I'm living in Yuzu's era 😍
"フィギュアスケートにあまり興味がなかったけど、このバラ1で衝撃を受けた。あまりにも美しくて…その後の白鳥にも美しさにも衝撃！
動画巡りをして羽生くんの今までのプログラムを知り、インタビューやら、ファンのブログなどもさかのぼりチェックしました。

羽生くんは最高で最強で、努力の天才何だと！

羽生くん、生まれて来てくれてありがとう！😭😭😭"
"Whoa. I know nothing about figure skating, but even I can tell that this is a gold performance. Everything, from the execution to the artistry… I have no words. As a musician, I understand how difficult it can be to embody a composer sometimes, but he did perfectly, while doing an extremely athletic sport. This is incredible, 1000/10

[Update]
I am now a huge fan of figure skating. I went and bought my own pair of gently used skates and I can’t wait to get on the ice and start learning this incredible art. I’ve discovered so many amazing skaters to cheer for, all because of the 2018 Olympics!"
"何かが憑依してる。
恐ろしくなるほど美しい。
ただのエレメンツをこなすスポーツではなく全てが調和され完成されている"
"3か月前に大怪我、ぶっつけ本番の平昌五輪SPバラード１番
今までとは違う深くメリハリのある美しいスケーティング
完璧な最高のジャンプ
息が止まるほど美しいステップ
ここまでショパンの似合う男子フィギュアスケーター見たことない
羽生結弦選手オリンピック２連覇達成"
スポーツなのにこんなにも｢芸術｣でいいのかよ……ありがとう……
"Every notes every moves, it's like a liquid gold.. My favorite SP from Pyeongchang!! Bravo Yuzuru!"
これほど技術と芸術が統一した演技を見たことがない。完璧、かつ美しい！いつ見ても感動します。
"Anyone notices at 1:11 just before he started his spin, his toe touches the ice JUST at the moment of that high music note.... if this is not magic I don't know what is...."
"ご飯も喉を通らず手に汗にぎり必死に応援したあの日を思い出します
本当に素晴らしいバラ１"
"羽生結弦選手、五輪連覇🥇おめでとうございます🎊
ぴょん落ちなので、生で見れてませんが😢テレビで見て感動しました‼️
こんなに美しいスケーターでお顔も美しく、スタイルも抜群で人間として出来た方は少なくともフィギュア界にはいないと思います🥹"
His aura is IMMEASUREABLE
"いつ見てもいい❗️、何度見てもいい❗️6年経たけど新鮮❗️2024 羽生結弦プロ更に進化の途中❗️
最強で最高なんだよ❣️"
"Other skater: Skate to music playing in the background
Yuzu: Music plays to his skating"
"3年ぶりにみたけどやっぱりすごい。
ジャンプの着地でさえ音に合わせてくる。どれだけこの曲を聴いて聴いて聴きまくってきたんだろう。本当にすごい。"
What a combination! It’s like watching Chopin’s notes dancing on the ice.
"""GIFT"" at Tokyo Dome  でのバラード第1番を観て、平昌五輪のパーフェクトな演技を観たくなりました。ケガが完治していないのに完璧で、羽生選手にしか成し得ないオリンピック２連覇という素晴らしい結果でした。羽生選手のバラード第1番は滑るごとに熟成しています。日本の、世界の宝と思います。"
최고다. 쇼팽 발라드 1번을 빙상위에서 아름답게 표현했다.
"Nathan may have broken his world record, but it will never compare to this performance."
このプログラムが1番好きでした。ステップシークエンスほんとすごい。
Nathan's 113.97 compares nothing with this masterpiece. The elegance of Yuzu's Chopin is above all.
この衣装似合いすぎてて大好き
"羽生さんのいない競技スケートの試合を見ると
無性に羽生さんの美しいスケートが見たくなって
定期的にこの傑作にもどってきます。"
This is perfection. His body is playing the music. He is literally flying over the ice.
"私はウインタースポーツが盛んでない国に長らく住んでおり羽生選手の名前は知っていたけど演技は見たことがなかった
この平昌のバラ1が初めて見た羽生選手の演技で本当に度肝を抜かれた
私のイメージにあった男子フィギュアと全く違い本当に全てが信じられないほど美しくてものすごく感動した
これは私がフィギュアに興味を持ち、羽生選手を応援するキッカケになったになった記念すべきプログラムでそれこそ何百回と見てるがいまだに感動で涙がこぼれる😢
点数的にはこれを超えるSPはあるだろうけど、人の心を捉えるSPという意味では、これを超えるプロはもう出ないだろう
それくらい衝撃的なプログラムです"
"私の中では、この演技がショートの世界最高得点です！
ただ跳べば良いスポーツじゃない。
音楽にピシッと美しく合わせて、滑らかにプログラムに溶け込ませてこそ。美しくて強い羽生結弦、最高だ。"
美しすぎる…エレガントなのに高難度の演技
いつみても感動します。演技終了後、観客席をみた羽生選手の、ほっとした表情は私を幸せにします。
"フィギュアスケートの真実はこの演技を見るとわかります。
最高の感動を有難う！
羽生選手最高です。"
"男ですが羽生さんがかっこよすぎます。
最高です！！！"
"Artistry aside, what attracted me from the first instance was how insanely fast he entered a jump. There were absolutely no hesitations prior to the jumps. He just got into the position and elevated into the air, so light and effortlessly, and landed smoothly, then went into the next move without any pause. It was as if the jump was supposed to be there. He did it as if it was as easy as walking down a street. Nothing too straining, nothing too difficult. It is just there. This can't be done without the absolute mastery of the jumps.
If someone says Hanyu is an artistic but not-so-technical skater, the person is literally calling him or herself stupid and ignorant. 
There are no skaters who show absolute mastery in jumps like Hanyu did."
"He never cheat, 
He is the definition of textbook skater
He is skillful,
His efforts in his costumes,
He skates with musical,
He pours his soul,
He is calculative,
He is smart,
He is genius,  
He is strong,
He is irreplaceable,
He is one in a lifetime athlete,
He is loved by the world,
He can gather people by his skating,
He is a great inspiration for others,
He is the Greatest of All Time figure skater.
He is Yuzuru Hanyu.

I am truly lucky to know him."
スタイルが良すぎる！！まさしく神に選ばれたスケーター！！
"未来永劫、色褪せない名演技
いつだって羽生結弦さんが世界一です！"
"Figure skating will never be the same without him. Watch how long he can hold the free leg after landing. I'am so lucky to live in this time, so I can see him. This is a gift. And I'am thankful for that."
"ショパンの音楽が羽生くんの後ろから自然とついてきているような演技ですね。
一つ一つの所作が魔法をかけているようで、なんとも美しい……"
He looks like an magical prince on the ice
"やはり私のオリンピックと言えばこれ。なんども見に来てしまう。感動をいつもありがとう。
日本人からではないコメントが多く、さすが世界的アスリートと再確認。羽生くん、これからの活躍も期待しています。"
"流れる水のよう…
優雅ででも繊細で、なんて美しい演技なんだろう"
He felt the music with all his body and soul
this has got to be one of the greatest step sequences of all time
"That's probably the best performance in Skating history to date. Visually, technically, physically, the entire package."
"音楽にぴったり合い
流れるように美しく
体全体、指先までの所作
全てが美しい
全フィギュアスケート選手の頂点
これこそ皆が求めていたフィギュアスケート
羽生選手はGOAT
彼こそがGOAT"
"Да, фантастически!!!!! На этой Олимпиаде Юзуру не было равных!!  Король льда!!!!!"
あまりにも神々しく、言葉を失います。
最後のステップの前に観客が悲鳴をあげる理由がよくわかる、、画面の前でも鳥肌が立つ😭💕
羽生結弦選手のバラード第1番は、フィギュア史に残る不朽の名作だと思います
何回見ても、また見たいと思う。
彼ほど魅了するスケターはいません
"Tatiana Tarasova said that this program ""is a program at the end of which you should not get up, but kneel down and thank God that we are lucky to see this"" and I couldn't agree more with her, Yuzuru Hanyu certainly is not unbeatable but he is totally insuperable"
His triple axel is the most beautiful I have ever seen. The quad axel by Malinin is no where near beautiful.
"After watching this for 6 years I am still brought to tears by this amazing performance, to this unforgetable music"
"音楽が全身から流れるように美しい‼
唯一無二、正真正銘のGOAT‼"
私はまだ16歳だが、これより良いパフォーマンスをするスケーターは現れないだろう。
大好きなバラード1番。演技後五輪連覇が現実になるかもと感動した演技でした。流石、羽生結弦選手と思いました。750万回再生おめでとうございます。
"何回観ても見飽き無いどころか、繰り返し見入ってしまう羽生結弦さんのスケート‼️です。
何年経とうが､観るほどにますます輝き出る演技に心打たれています。
アイス　ストーリー3 始まりますね、羽生結弦さん、見せて頂けるだけで😃幸せです😃。"
"男性でこの曲でこれだけ違和感なく滑ることできる人いない。
唯一無二！"
"このプログラムのためにショパンが180年前に作曲したのかとすら思うよね
すべてが完璧で美しい✨"
Yuzuru Hanyu can be outscored but never outperformed.  This is the most beautiful Olympic figure skating program ever
"Yuzuru Hanyu , you can't imagine how many people still admires you and your art. It's a shame that I've never watched live of your skating. Maybe if there's a chance in the future if my very first wish"
何回でも見にきちゃう。圧巻
This is still the best performance and worthy of world record.
フィギュアスケートの最高傑作です
今の男子フィギュアを見ていて、いまだに羽生さんが居ないのが寂しい。羽生さんの演技が猛烈に見たくなってここに来た☺️
"Watched the last Men's GP competitions and found myself coming back here again. The only male skater who never bored me. The only one I could enjoy watching every time. With the competitions slowly turning into jumping competitions and tarnished by over scoring and just crossovers, programs like this cleanses my eyes. There will never be another skater like him. Some skaters may surpass him in terms of quads but nobody will surpass his musicality, interpretation and artistry. He shows what real figure skating is meant to be. The perfect, textbook skater. The Axel Overlord. The Prince on Ice."
果然配得上“容颜如玉，身姿如松，翩若惊鸿，婉若游龙”。看别人滑冰是看比赛，看羽生滑冰是在欣赏美丽的表演。冰上人如玉，公子世无双！
『SEIMEI』と共にフィギュア史に残る不朽の名作です。
羽生くんのファンでもなんでもないし、フィギュアのルールとかも何も知らないけど、すごく綺麗に見える。これがプロか…
"I was shivering and awed his historic performance. He said after the Olympics in fact he had been so nervous for skating in public in months. He had jumped triple axel for three weeks and quad for two weeks just before this day, with his painful right ankle! That was ridiculous and unbelieavable! His tenacious spirit did the trick! It was the moment when I realized only Yuzuru would deserve the gold medal. 来たーやっと来た！＼(^o^)／待ってたこの歴史に残るSPを！！今もあの時の緊張と興奮は忘れられない。震えが止まらなかった。実は羽生君もすごく緊張したそうだ（信じられない！)金メダルを確信した瞬間でした。"
"this is no longer sport, this is art."
Still can't believe this is not a world record
"Was für ein wunderbarer Mensch, Sportler und Künstler. Ich hoffe, er wird seine neue Form der Eiskunstshows verknüpft mit Philosophie noch lange weiterentwickeln. Ich werde ihn dabei unterstützen!"
"I remember this day...after two hours of watching the other skaters, the moment he sets out onto the ice, this tension overwhelmed me and it's probably even more apparent and clear for those watching it live. It was a make-it or break-it moment. Will he endure the injury or will it succumb him.
The moment he landed that first quad, tears rolled down my cheeks. The moment that he landed his beautiful triple axel, a voice echoed through the entire rink if not the whole world... that we are seeing a living legend there and then. 
It's been months since the Olympics but I just want to say this again... Welcome back, champion <3"
He's still the best i've ever seen.
i know nothing about skating but this is just too beautiful i wanna cry
"Every time I hear Chopin's Ballade No 1, I always come back here. This performance never fails to move me to tears. Our world has been blessed with the skating of Yuzuru Hanyu. The Best Figure Skater of All Time.. no one can convince me otherwise."
This is *exactly* what Chopin would have wanted
たとえ記録が破られても数十年経っても見返したくなる芸術的なプログラム
Still the best Short Program existed and no world records can't beat this performance.
"Everything he does is breathtaking. I have been to an Olympic ice stadium, and they are massive. The speed the skaters travel over the ice to cover the whole rink is just staggering. Yuzuru has brought much joy to those who enjoy the sport, and continues to do so. I think he's a beautiful person inside and out."
彼をずーっと応援します❤
バラ🌹1は、何度観ても、素晴らしいです。
The best Olympic men’s short program
"하뉴에게 중독됨ㅠ하뉴 남은 삶도
보상받는 삶  살아요.."
これ何回も見れる。バラードめっちゃ好きやし、羽生くんの演技が綺麗すぎてやばい。見とれてしまう
ジャンプは相変わらず助走などほとんどなく、それぞれのエレメンツが完全に音楽に溶け込んでいる。スポーツということを忘れてしまう。これほどのパフォーマンスを見ることができて、深い幸せを感じる。
He is a miracle that has landed on the ice.
"진짜진짜 잘한다 입 벌리고 감탄하면서 봤음, 의상도 잘 골랐넹"
"このショートのゆづは完璧すぎた。
このショートが1番好きだし平昌はほんとに最高だったなぁ
ゆづ大好き
これからも応援してるよ〜"
in 2023 i’m still crying…masterpiece!
"dont worry yuzuru, in our hearts this will always hold the record"
やっぱりこのプログラムめっちゃ好き
I have entered a fandom I didn't know existed until today
ほぼ毎日みている・・。言葉を失うほどのすばらしさ。圧巻の演技。表現力に脱帽です。
"I only came to know Yuzuru since Beijing Olympics and I regretted not having discovered such a gem earlier on.  As someone who can't tell the difference between the different types of jumps and a classical music lover, I am drawn to him because he made the music alive.  It is almost like he became the music.  Of course, this can only be done with superb skating techniques and jump landings that look light and effortless.  This programme and also his Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso programme are masterpieces and will withstand the test of time, just like Chopin's and Saint-Saens' music."
我相信，羽生结弦，是花滑历史中最惊艳的伟大运动员。
this is  what ice skate artistic is... beautyful
日本の誇り。史上最高のフィギュアスケーター。
“The greatest short program of all time”
"Its 2024, Yuzuru Hanyu still remains a poetry, This Chopin Olympic Performance still remains as one the best poetries he have.UGHHH"
"I was just here for the ballade as a pianist, but this guy is awesome"
2:05 How does he just yolo a perfect triple axel like that
"Speechless, he is like an angel in ice."
真是太美太漂亮了，不知道用什么语言来形容，羽生在艺术和技术的表演如此的美丽动人，看了很多遍都看不腻，花样滑冰男单运动员只有羽生的表演能打动我的心！我会永远支持你爱你柚子加油 🥰
This is the TRUE Olympic record SP.
Chopin and yuzuru hanyu are just gods
"As a ballet and contemporary dancer, the ways he uses his arms and spins is so beautiful! The perfect balance of grace and power."
我已經看了十次以上了⋯⋯結弦的動作都踩在節奏點上，這都是心血結晶啊！完美契合音樂的舞步讓一切融為一體⋯⋯謝謝你羽生結弦，還有柚子的教練，他看起來就像對待親兒子一樣的互動，還有比賽主辦。最重要的，謝謝你柚子，謝謝你以堅強的意志持續著目標，才帶給大家這樣的藝術。
This is still the best SP performed ever. The 4T - 3T is musically so on point
"i can never get tired of watching this. today was probably the 150th time i’ve rewatched this program. his form, his body lines, his technique, his musicality, his attention to detail, his timing, his interpretation, his transitions, his body awareness, the way he makes simple choreography so difficult to outdo— and this is not to say this program is easy, no, no it really isn’t, and anyone who says otherwise are certainly uncultured. but when you compare him to others who complete standout moves to make the crowd roar and complex choreography they sometimes stumble over for how strongly they are pushing their bodies to compete in the same realm as him, this program is the definition of strength in subtlety. he is a rare phenomenon. a raw talent amidst the talents in all sport. the mentality he possesses is beyond what any of us can comprehend."
we all know this performance is truly deserving of a world record
He makes it look so much easier than it is
"I can see many people saying than Nathan Chen is an amazing skater who beats Yuzuru. Well, maybe, when you look at the scores and points since 2018 Olympics. But Yuzuru has such a deep understanding of music and emotions, it’s unbelievable! He has this beautiful aura around him, every move is well thought through, every element matches with another and all of it completes the whole performance. Nathan is great, but after rewatching his 2018 performances at the Olympics he was just completing elements, while in Yuzuru programs everything is so continues and I never get bored of watching his skating. I might not be a skater, but I am classical musician, and Yuzuru is a really big inspiration to me!"
Simply the most beautiful perfection that will ever be.
歓声、演技の完成度、衣装と会場の色合、選曲、オリンピックという舞台、全てがマッチした史上最高のスケーティングだと思う。
"Nathan C would never admit it but he was rattled to the core when he had to perform directly after this magnificent, powerful and sublime work of art. Anyone would have been."
This wasn't skating. This was liquid gold on ice.
The most beautiful Olympic short program! Love it!
Those 15 seconds of total stillness in the beginning is absolute genius.
羽生結弦選手ご自身とショパンの調べとの完全な融合。この演技はバラード第1番そのものです。いつまでも観ていたい真のフィギュアスケートがここにあります。
He’s already a legend. No one compares to his full package ART & sport.
5年経った今見ても、何度見返しても、その度に涙が出てしまう素晴らしい演技、なんと美しい芸術作品‼️
There is something so ethereal about him. You just watch his every movement and can't look away. He is truly not of this planet.
今、観ても泣ける。
This is figure skating above the best.Only YUZURU HANYU can do that.
He was the first to perform in the last group. Don't forget that he also had a serious injury but bringing a performance like this. Unbelievable! He is technically and spiritually irresistible. Everytime it is breath taking.
"I came for the Chopin, but stayed for the incredible skater."
Bro is the top tier. He took the lead before he was even halfway through his program
"Best Sp in olympic history, tbh this should
Have been world record"
"Chopin's Ballade No. 1 is in it's own class. No matter how many times you have watched it, you will still get mesmerised and fully absorbed into the program. This program is in another realm of its own."
You can't even imagine how much i wanted to forget this masterpeace and watch it as if it were my first time :')
"もうただただ美しい
素晴らしすぎて言葉を失う
曲と衣裳も含めて全てが一つの芸術作品のよう
他のスケーターとは別次元です"
全てが美しい
"Most just go through the motions, nearly on beat, but Yuzuru is always one with the music and choreography. He’s an incredible athlete, but he’s an artist like no other!"
"Как по клавишам пробежался. Лучший, лучший на все времена! GOAT. 
Какое чувство музыки, какие прыжки идеальные - в струночку, красивые, пролётные."
The only Olympic champion in my heart.
2023 and i'll still never get bored of him.
"After each performance, he stays longer with the audience to acknowledge them with his bows, ……how can the audience not love him…."
平昌オリンピックの男子フィギュア、ゆずくん完璧だわね
Can't get over the fact that he looks like he's just floating through a white abyss. Absolutely stunning
we need a museum to keep this ART
"素晴らしい演技は何度見ても飽きることはありません。史上最高のスケーターと同じ時代を生きられることに感謝します。
HANYU YUZURU is GOAT！"
I'm back here after the Echoes of life to watch this masterpiece again. It still moves me to my core.
Those first 17 seconds of the music where he has the audacity to remain absolute still gave me  a foreboding of his originality and creativity.
Whenever he skates ...the feeling is so magical...I feel like I'm immersed in some magic wonderland...
He is the best skater in the world.
Super thrilled to see Yuzu perform the Ballade No. 1 in his new epic solo ice show Echoes of Life. The greatest people keeps evolving ❤❤
Your legacy in Men's figure skating will always remain. Forever the GOAT!
never forget that he literally skated like this with a severe injury and while taking painkillers. no one will ever top his greatness
"This performance embodies Chopin so virtuously, like he's his living muse in the present day 💙"
This performance is breathtaking!
He lands his jumps as he defines gravity light as a feather & leaves no trace on the ice.  It was also said by the ice repair team when Yuzure skates he hardly leaves any imprint on the ice compared to other skaters with their heavy & clumsy landing of their jumps. Yuzure is truly born to skate. He glides & flies through his programs with ease & grace of a true skater. He is truly a divine being.
Yuzuru Hanyu is the world's best by any standard. What an artist and athlete!
This is still a masterpiece and the greatest short program in fs history. The best ever in balancing both technical and artistry. So elegant. So beautiful. So fluid. Looks so simple yet complex. One with the music. It has everything that define figure skating.
Its amazing its like he's in a trance when he's skating
The way he closes his eyes and just commands his skating is so amazing.
Who else are watching his performances after announcing his retirement? A true legend will never be forgotten.
He’s totally playing the music with his skating skills.😮😮
I’ve never seen such beauty
I don't get why Nathan's SP broke this magical world record
His routine could promote world peace. Provides such calmness when you watch him perform!
Easily the best short program of all time. I had to drop by for the mandatory weekly appreciation of this classic. Rondo can surpass this and I can't wait to see him come back with his latest sp.
Обожаю смотреть на его катание. Милый мальчик лицо как у ребёнка.❤
Can't believe Yuzuru is retiring. That's the best skating I've seen in my life.
"羽生くんのスケートが無性に見たくなってまた戻って来ました🥲

何度見ても美しい。"
"The fact that I can witness his performance, artistry and immense LOVE for skating in this lifetime, albeit not in person, is an insane privilege. There will never be another like Yuzuru Hanyu in the world of ice skating, the first who truly showed the beauty of the sport in my eyes. Though I don't understand anything about the technicalities, his art has touched my heart so deeply that I didn't think a sport could do."
"always coming back here, to the athlete who introduced me to art first, i will forever keep all the memories and tell about him around the world, as I am the witness of an artist through the years… i’ll forever wish the best to yuzuru, hopefully he’ll achieve more and more moments of pure happiness in life"
"The beauty, the art, the technique, the connection with the audience... it has it all. Yuzuru is really from another planet, he is incredible and he is the most complete of all the skaters. It is a true legend, it is hypnotic."
"フィギュアスケート競技の最高峰
技術と芸術の融合"
"It's been 5 years, but still get thrilled when seeing him finished all the elements perfectly. 😭"
На это можно смотреть бесконечно.......
"I always knew his name but haven't seen his performance before Beijing. After deeply moving by his performance at the Beijing gala, I saw the Ballad No. 1 for the first time. It's a really exquisite experience. I can't believe I literally SAW the music. It's so beautiful and elegant. I believe it's the ideal figure skating for me and I couldn't help rewatching it over and over again."
美しい❤
"4T3Tのジャンプの頂点が完全にピアノの音に合致しているのが、何度観ても鳥肌が立つ。
これまで多くの選手によって数多の4T3Tが跳ばれてきたけど、この時のものを超えるのはそうそうないんじゃないかと思うし、GOE満点つかなかったのもよくわからない。"
"C’è qualcosa di speciale in Yuzuru Hanyu, qualcosa che lo rende imparagonabile a chiunque, e non è solo il suo incredibile talento tecnico e artistico, la sua innata eleganza, il suo incredibile istinto musicale per cui sono i suoi pattini a produrre la musica o la sua innata bellezza; credo che abbia a che fare con la sua mente impareggiabile, con quella filosofia tutta orientale per cui la bellezza è nell’equilibrio di ogni cosa, quell’equilibrio che trasforma anche uno sport olimpico in arte e che lui insegue da tutta la vita e che nessun sistema di punteggi potrà mai valutare."
"하뉴의 발라드, 볼때마다 너무 아름답다는 말밖엔...피아노 선율과 하뉴가 하나로, 함께 존재하며 빛나고 있어. 남싱 여싱 통틀어 이렇게 완벽하고 아름다운 선수가 또 나올수 있을까...? 차원이 다른 퍼포먼스. 사랑한다 유즈야.♡♡♡"
"There are no quad lutz and quad flip in this program, but frankly it doesn't matter. Most of Hanyu Yuzuru's short programs are excellent, but Chopin Ballad No. 1 is literally a ""masterpiece."" I'm sure figure skating fans will be back here in 10, 20, or even 100 years. This is not just a fan base issue, but because this program is a landmark in men's figure skating."
"Technical elements aside, what leaves you speachless is the flow, the connections,  the edges, the rythm,  the way he is always moving, drawing on the ice. You could cut away the jumps from the routine,  and it would be a complete materpiece nontheless.  Pure poetry."
THIS IS WHAT I LIVE FOR THIS IS LITERALLY ART
"Yuzu said ""I'm back""
Ghislain and the World said ""WELCOME BACK, THE G.O.A.T.!"""
"I have to admit to only seeing this yesterday. I won’t lie, I cried. It’s breathtaking, it’s unbelievable! My tears fell in the sheer beauty, and obvious near impossible dedication he must have put into his art. He is an art form."
We'll be blessed if he competes at the next Olympics
Одна из лучших коротких программ в истории мужского фк. Сколько грации и изящества и в то же время силы в каждом движении. Настоящее исскуство
"If you've been searching for the most beautiful figure skating performance in the world, this might be it."
This is a performance that goes beyond a medal and a podium.👑
"I had a bad day, so I'm spending my evening watching all of Yuzu's Olympic programs... This is one of his most beautiful, and I think it's a very comfortable program for him. He always does phenomenally with it"
He's always hit differently when he skates. The technicality and artistry were greatly balanced. There's just really an emotion I can't name that I feel whenever he performs. It's just really different. He owns it everytime.
羽生结弦就是有史以来最伟大的花样滑冰运动员，绝无仅有！
This very performance is why I decided to put on a pair of figure skating boots and get on the ice; coming from a poor backwater town in South Africa. Every time I watch this it pushes me to push myself; even after tearing my MCL in a fall in practice. From the eyes of a beginner; this is the epitome of inspiration! Thank you @YuzuruHanyu for making the dreams of a young boy a reality. Thank you for your artistry.
"No matter how many times I watch this, I'm still get captivated by this performance."
i just found out about him and this piece is my favorite but this guy literally gave me goosebumps watching him dances through the piece its absolutely beautiful
Hearing his skating sounds on ice is so satisfying
Perhaps the most impactful and complete figure skating program ever.
"I was rewatching this year 2022 and I am still having goosebumps and tears.Hanyu will always be unique.He's a complete aesthetic figure skater material.Not just focusing on technical elements but also adding elegance and beauty.This is pure art.He is not just focusing on the sports itself but taking it into extraordinary show,such a great person.Nobody can be compared to him,he will always be majestic!Bravo!ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ"
He has a soul more than skating. I see many skaters only skating but thats is an art
最後のコンビネーションからコーダのステップに入るところの音と動きのシンクロがもう堪らん🎵
We all know that this is really still the best of all.
"Yuzuru has always been a breathtaking skater. The way he comes out of that quad into a spread eagle is remarkable enough. That he did it while badly injured is just astounding. The sport is going to be much poorer not having him competing on the ice now, but I look forward to seeing what he will be able to bring to a professional skating career."
An example of what true figure skating is. 👏
本物は永遠に輝き続ける✨
What a treat to watch such a high class performance! A combination of difficult technical elements and artistry makes Yzuru a real figure skating prodigy.
"No one has ever come close to him. He isn't just skating, he becomes the dance, it moves through him. The beauty and eloquence of his every move are so compelling, it makes the watcher feel deeply. Nathan is a great technical skater but will never compare to hanyu in artistry"
Yuzuru has the physical abilities but his artistry is untouchable. He’s absolutely the BEST ever.
i suddenly miss this so here i am..
hanyu's programs always feels  so connected u sometimes dont know when hes gonna jump. its all one performance. there are a lot of technically insane skaters now but their programs tend to look like jumping drills. sadly isu prefers this too
"And he pulled THAT off with severe ankle injury which he led everyone believe had recovered.  He's an athlete, an artist and also a strategist. Words can't describe how amazing he is."
"The difference between Hanyu and other skaters: 
- Others: skating with the support of music
- Yuzuru Hanyu: the music itself is skating on the ice"
羽生选手🌈Happy Birthday 🌈Love & Support from Hawaii🌈
He looks like a cloud floating on ice
"Юдзуру -гений, а Чен -хороший спортсмен в форме(его провал в Сочи был сокрушительным). Когда Ханю здоров, ему равных нет.  Чену , даже если он выигрывает, Юдзуру в плане изящества, красоты , харизмы, великолепия не обойти. В катании Юдзуру есть свет и благородство!"
He skates like he's dancing on clouds rather than ice
O kendini bulunduğu ortamdan tamamen soyutluyor ve tek başına dünyayının en iyi şovunu yapıyor o bir mvp
"What a joy to watch this young man. He has brought back the BEAUTY of skating to the sport!!! years ago, the beauty along with the perfection was in skating, but in recent years only the difficulty was done, not the choreography to music, just jumps....this young man has finally brought back the beauty, difficulty and imagination....Thank you Yuzuru Hanyu and your coaches!!!"
"As a classical pianist this is GOALS. Sadly, I would never be able to play AND skate at the same time... And his skating is FRICKING INCREDIBLE!!!"
"Dear skating god, thank you for giving us Yuzuru Hanyu. Every time I see him skate (even just practice), I feel the world is wonderful. Dear Yuzu, thank you for being such a angelic human being. You embody art, beauty, purity, athleticism, sportsmanship, and the best of human spirit. Like the journalist at the Foreign Correspondents' press conference said following your 2nd Olympic victory, in today's world where fake news abound, your existence is particularly meaningful and heartwarming. May you have all the health, happiness, and success you desire."
当時大怪我してからわずか3ヶ月後ということを微塵にも感じさせない羽生結弦さんの演技に感無量です。
"Your Lie in April fans, who else cried or teared after realizing this piece was played By Kousei as his farewel for Kaori?? I cried watching this :,("
"Yuzuru Hanyu will always be the king, the emperor of ice skating <3"
"I used to watch figure skating until I discovered Yuzu.  Now I only watch him.  Can't watch anyone else.  The GOAT now and forever. No one else combines technical skill, artistry,  musicality and the ability to perform under pressure like he does."
"Chen根本无法与yuzuru相提并论，yuzuru的滑冰充满了炉火纯青的技巧，你能看到整个节目中完美融入音乐的步法、跳跃、旋转.而chen,他只能堪堪站住跳跃！"
"rewatching this program always takes my breath away. No matter how many times I've seen it, the moment the music starts and Yuzuru stays still, in the middle of the arena, he brings me back into his world. Thank you, Yuzuru.🥰"
yuzuru is someone who nails his jumps and everything but still keeps the beauty and art strong whenever he iceskates
I am amazed how graceful and fierce he is. I cant keep my eyes away whenever he is skating
"This is still the best short program ever, from the very first note till the end"
"Skill, technique, artistry, musicality... He simply has it all. He grows wings on the ice and flies off the Earth to a planet without gravity and we are left to wonder what kind of magic it takes to achieve this level of legendary."
"今見ても、なんて美しい演技なんでしょう😍
心が洗われます✨
ここまで音楽を奏でるスケーターは、今後も出てこないと思います。
本当に美しい✨✨✨"
I can watch him skate forever
"After seeing what makes yuzuru hanyu special in his ice skate I realize that he’s not to light whether heavy looks in his performance this after i take compare with others figures skating 
So yuzuru hanyu is perfection in balance all the ways"
"Pinnacle of figure skating. He unites athleticism and artistry on an unparalleled level. No other matches his quality. This is incomparable, in a class of its own."
美しくて神々しい恍惚のプログラム。衝撃的でした。何度見ても涙が溢れてきて心が浄化されます。
"I 'm always stunned when Yuzuru landed from 3A on the ice just pinpointing to the piano note! 
After the Olympics he said, "" I always pay attention to skate to music because that makes the audience feel good. However, poising on the brink between skating to music well and not to so precise is important and makes differnce when skating."" I wonder would other skaters think of that?
何度見ても震えがくるが、特に3Aの着氷の時ピアノの一音がドンピシャでめまいがするほど痺れる。
五輪後のアイスショーの取材で羽生君は音ハメは見てる人も気持ちいいので気をつけているが、「音に合わせすぎる時とそんなに合わせていないバランスが気持ち良さに違いが出る」と言っていて、まさにそれを体現した演技だな、深いなあと思いました。"
"羽生結弦さん、演技のしなやかさと
美しさ"
"How they roar for him. Truly, what a privilege it is to watch Hanyu Yuzuru skate"
4:39 “comeback!” THE BEST AND MOST PERFECT  COMEBACK INDEED
Absolute grace and perfection. No Ice Skater can out perform him. He is the personification of an artist on Ice. (Frozen Ice)🤩
I hope this comment gets a lot of likes so it can be pushed to the top. Film production units please contact Yuzuru to make a documentary about his life and career so that audiences all over the world can see his playing time. I will be crazy happy. I am a fan from Vietnam
I can not count the times I've watched this performance. It is absolutely mesmerizing! Yuzuru is definitely the Greatest Of All Time.
3 years later and it still blows our minds 💛 Such an honour to watch him perform on our blades
"Yuzu's 3A should've gotten a +5GOE. So clean. The takeoff, the heights, the landing, and those entrance and exit.. Outstanding!"
"演技前は吐きそうになりながら
皮膚に爪が食い込んで後がつくほど手を握りしめて
演技中は一緒に飛びながら見守って
フィニッシュでは涙で何も見えないくらい号泣したな…
人生で1番感動した瞬間だった。"
I don’t even know anything about this sport he’s the only one I watch I love his outfits his beautiful smile and his determination beautiful
that was a flawless run and he made it look easy
This guy is just perfect
That day the news in my small country published news from the Olympics and mentioned an amazing Japanese. I looked up his program on YouTube and fell in love with his skating. It's been like that every day since then 💙💙💙🇧🇦
This program really is a BIG MASTERPIECE in figure skating.❤
So this is what perfection looks like….
2:54 No one can ever be as elegant as Yuzuru Hanyu
羽生選手の演技が恋しくてたまらない。
"I found him randomly yesterday, when I fell down the youtube rabbit hole and have been watching his different performances since. Even though I know nothing about this sport/art, I find this really magical and I would love to join this fandom."
"This music is so deep, and Yuzuru manages to make a interpretation of the music that no one else would do. He puts his soul into the art, that's what makes me love him so much."
"Never seen this guy before but he skates with a wild elegance that seems to test the very boundaries that contain him 
Edit: Is my poetic showing?"
年轻的王者六周年快乐！⛸🪽🥇🎉
This is true art in all its perfection.
"So who's back rewatching this electrifying moment at 2022?
Let's welcome Yuzu to his 3rd Olympics Beijing 2022 and wish him well!"
"Watching the new generation of almost purely technical figure skating always makes me want to watch Yuzu's performances... so here I am again, praying that someday figure skating will become art again."
"彼が演技すると、まるでピアノを演奏してるかのようです。
曲の世界に入り込んで、夢のような美しい時間に浸れます。"
"I don’t know much about skating, but the fact that watching Yuzu makes it impossible for me to watch any other skaters tells a lot."
"This was a masterpiece!!  every note ,every move,the way he could feel the music ... Epic performance!"
"This is what a two-OG gold medalist looks like, the only GOAT in the history of figure skating."
"あの大けがのあと、出場出来るのか心配でなりませんでしたが見事な演技
どれだけ努力なさったのでしょう
素晴らしい演技を見せていただいてありがとうございます♥"
Anyone rewatching this masterpiece after he retired?
"Это просто божественно!
Красавец фигурист под классическую музыку!
Брависсимо! Виртуоз, лучшее выступление за всю историю ❤"
It’s like Chopin wrote this music for him.
"개인적으로 첫 손에 꼽는 하뉴 선수의 퍼포먼스입니다 🥰올림픽 무대에서 늘 리스크를 감수하며 고난도 동작을 하다보니 더러 넘어지기도 했는데, 쇼팽 발라드 연기는 시종일관 깔끔했고  2:40 특히, 음악이 클라이막스를 향해 치닫을 때, 음악과 하나되는 표현력을 보여줘서 한순간 전율이 쫘악 느껴졌어요 👍"
Я лучше фигуриста в одиночном катании в жизни не видела.Да ещё и под музыку баллады Шопена.Гений.
"これほどこの曲を表現したフィギュアスケートは無い。
なぜ羽生結弦の演技に人々が惹きつけられるのかISUは冷静に考えたほうがいい。"
"Graceful, flawless. One of the most beautiful skaters i've ever seen"
"Гений фигурного катания , Юдзуру Ханью !!!❤❤❤❤"
"I think there's this thing called ""body lines"" in dancing where the position of one's body, especially limbs, can form great and satisfying figures or images for the people watching. It's not limited to symmetrical positions but also just the positions of the limbs relative to each other. I think Yuzuru knows about body lines quite well."
歴代最高のフィギュアスケーター❕何度見ても感動❕
This epic performance will soon celebrate its 3rd anniversary. I can't count how many times I've already watch it. Perfection in every way.
"昨日たまアリ最終日参加させて頂きました。昨日の羽生さんのバラ１は
なんら数ミリの衰えもなくそれどころか今季最高得点でもいい位の出来でした。それは今でも現役以上に努力をしていられるからだと思います。どうか怪我がしないよう祈ります。"
"Everyone already knows that Yuzuru is the best of the bests, but I think he really outdid himself in this performance. As if some century-old spirit of grace and technique possessed him but nope. This was all him. The momentary parentheses the world saw him in; the awed, hushed, and reverent aura that seemed to cascade his every skate; and the somehow overflowing yet, at the same time, subtle emotion and poignancy he carries in his entire performance—it was all him. And I never get tired of it."
Yuzuru is an ARTIST 🎶 The beauty of his performance  is beyond words.
"Can this child pass through space-time???? Does he know Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov???... Is this child a ballerina or an athlete??? Incredible skill, multiplied by an incredible sense of artistry🌺🍀🌺🍀🌺🍀❤️❤️❤️"
"凄いのはこの大会の前に足首の
怪我をして皆んなが絶望視してる
中それ以来初の大会で華麗な
カンバックそしてこの演技は
カッコ良かった😮"
"The king of figure skating, Yuzuru Hanyu!"
this performance will always remain a *masterpiece*
This is soooooooo beautiful. Why only 5M views? It deserves 15M😮
5年前の今日、ゆづくん最高に美しい！🎉
"Как профессиональный музыкант,могу сказать одно - Он полностью воплотил Шопена. Как Шопен оказал мировое влияние своей музыкой,так и он своим катанием .Браво Гений!!!👏👏👏 И как говорит Татьяна Анатольевна Тарасова,есть музыка, где нельзя ошибаться. Вот вам и идеальный образец воплощения!!!"
this man is art
"Even his record got broken , but no one can beat his aesthetics and full of artistic Emotion in the performance ... Truly Masterpiece ❤"
"Always watch and always best, our GOAT YUZURU HANYU"
"Do you ever come back to this after a while and go ""omgosh why is he so good"" all over again?"
"He's beauty,
He's grace,
He will skate to first place."
"This is one of my favourite piano pieces ever, and seeing him performing to this music... It's one of the greatest emotions that I will ever experience, a flawless interpretation with this unique romantic and elegant style he has. Everything is  exquisite and a pleasure for the eyes, hope to see him performing live someday ♥️"
I came back here after watching all the figure skating matches. Everyone will.
"I have seen a lot of Skaters in my lifetime, he is just plain Amazing.  He is so excited to please the audience and enjoys the satisfaction of his fantastic performance."
Талант від Бога!!! Йому рівних немає
"He makes me proud to be human ...

You know how Japanese people feel proud being Japanese? Well, I am nowhere near Japanese, but I still feel proud. 

He makes me proud that humans are able to do such beautiful things. Does it make sense?"
"Не перестаю восхищаться, талантище,магия на льду"
It looks like he's not even in control of his body anymore... The music has just taken it over. Beautiful.
Настоящий шедевр! Лучший!!!
"I looked at the presentation score and like… 48?? Even Yuzuru was like “48…” definitely underscored imo, no one captures a crowd like him! And with that step sequence?! Big sigh 
But he still won! All my love to Yuzuru 💙✨"
Happy 6th year anniversary of Yuzu's Chopin 💖
"“I’m so proud of you, you’re so brave.” Thank you, Brian, for telling him the words from our heart."
*Seriously tho the PCS should have been around 49.5 SO UNDERSCORED*
"I can't tell how many times watching him skate helped me during panic attacks and other ""fun"" mental health issues. I started following him a year ago after a random youtube suggestion and since then he became a source of solace for me (and in the process I became obsessed with figure skating as well). Art it's something that can deeply move me, and to me his skate is pure artistry."
The timing to the music with the 4t-3t is just impecable. A case of jumps actually fitting to the music.
"У меня нет слов. Он просто король фигурного катания, приклоняюсь перед его талантом и огромным трудом"
He is the music.
"Es intemporal. Durante toda la vida, seguiré volviendo aquí cuando siente la necesidad de ver este arte. Gracias mil, Yuzu."
"Lyrical & graceful, yet passionate & powerful. Yuzuru is inspirational."
yuzuru is such a magnificent performer. he creates art which completes his intricate skating. he's not just an athlete... he's an art himself.
"The way he embodies the characters, gestures, and articulations of the music elevates this from sport to art. One can imagine a choreographer such as George Balanchine really appreciating and admiring this performance. It is a plotless ballet of sorts, where the technique serves the art. Hanyu absolutely deserved the gold for such an accomplishment."
"I love this program.
 The most beautiful 
The most noble 
The most delicate."
it's insane that if there wasn't a hole in the ice he would have performed this even more flawlessly. genuinely such a masterful class act. the love he holds for his craft seeps out of his performance at every turn
One of my favorite moments is when his blade turns at 1:50 right on the note of the music.
"Did you find his blades were black? He said at the ice show after the Olympics he had replaced silver blades with black ones, because he didn't want 'the SILVER color!
ブレードが黒だったことに気づきましたか？実はシルバーから黒にしたそう。五輪後のアイスショーで言ってました。「'銀色'を少しでもなくしたかったから」！さすが徹底してるね羽生君！"
The very best of a short program in figure skating at any Winter Olympic! Total RESPECT!
He IS the music!
I might ba late for this but i'm glad I was able to know a Yuzuru Hanyu! Full of emotion and passion 💞
Просто восхитительно! Полная гармония с музыкой великого Шопена. Юдзуру непревзойденный мастер!
"Настоящий олимпийский чемпион! Достоин своей награды, кто бы что не говорил! ❤❤"
これ最高👏上手すぎる。まさか直前に怪我してる状態からの復帰試合には見えなかった。てかこの衣装めちゃくちゃ似合うし。つくづくドラマを起こす人だよな。やっぱり見ごたえがあっておもしろい、羽生結弦。常に先頭を突っ走ってほしい。
"Музыка и катание совпало на 100% всю красоту нот прочувствовал, это спектакль балет. Гениальный!!"
"This will never crease to blow my mind.
He spend months off ice from a horrible ankle injury. Had to start from the top again, with only less than 3 weeks of training before the olympics. 
And then he came back and BAM!
Perfect short program. Fricking incredible!"
"111...Yuzuru gestrured with his finger ! How cute and he looked calm. He was like a Zen master!
He said after the Olympics he had tried to keep calm because he would have FP next day, though Orser said Yuzuru had looked disappointed because he didn' t get the world record.
指で「111」…なんてかわいくて冷静なんだろう。
オーサーコーチは世界最高記録をとれなくてがっかりしてるように見えたと言ってたけど、羽生君は次の日FPがあるから冷静に感情を爆発させないようにしていたとか。世界中の注目と興奮をよそに彼ただ１人王者の振る舞いでしたね。"
"To skate like that, you have to have passion. He is at one with the ice ❤  Outstanding"
"back when figure skaters were judged by their artistry, not fully by technical jumps. ISU protocol totally screws this sport"
I'll never get tired of watching this
"So beautiful, never tired to see..."
This will stay in people's minds forever!
"5 months later this video finally graces YouTube but BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!! 

Thank you for finally uploading."
"2020 and I’m still not over this . 
King ."
It's insane how he delivered this performance with such quality while being on painkillers...
氷の上で遊んでいるみたい。優雅な芸術。羽生くんは世界一のスケーターなんだよなぁ！
"That was an awesome comeback for him and for us! From that moment our hopes were answered, he was there, ready to fight! Thank you so much Yuzuru for all the hard work and for inspiration! :)"
"Starting at 2:37, the way he begins to wildly yet precisely fling his arms about as the crowd roars and cheers is just...wow. After completing his set jumps well, I can imagine the exhilaration, overwhelming dizziness, and euphoria he must have felt.
Also, 1:18 is absolutely gorgeous, I'm happy they included an overhead shot."
this is still the best performance EVER
This is the most beautiful 4T+3T jump I ever seen
"Chopin & Yuzuru, Legendary Combination 🤩🤩🔥
His Movements  sooo Smooth , all jumps look Flawless 💎 ,  His Emotion and Artistry ... just Masterpiece"
I'm speechless.. That mastery is crazy!
"Юдзуру непровзойденный, невероятно талантливый фигурист на все времена!!! Можно прыгать четверные лутцы и флипы, но такой харизмы, такой грации и полного погружения в музыку нет ни у кого больше! Невероятный, непревзойденный ЮДЗУРУ!!!"
Is this magic or what? I've watched this for countless times and everytime he makes me feel so breathtaking!!
This cannot be real. But it is. Thrilling. It is magic that this level of art and intellect and athleticism exists. We are blessed to have seen it. How lucky are those who were there!
This will be long long remembered as one of the most superb figure skating program...he is superb...power and beauty!
"2:32 —> I can’t even call it the most innovative or groundbreaking in terms of choreography, but the way he executes it is just….. so remarkable. The whole program was a mixture of crescendos and decrescendos, escalating and de-escalating, all the way until he hits the climax. It felt like I was waiting; just waiting and waiting, when all of a sudden he glides out of that rippon 3T with so much skill and ease evident of expertise that can only be attained from years of experience being the world’s very best, and everything just hits. His body resembled a folded reflection against an uninterrupted stream of water then, but here it felt like watching the wind lurch so abruptly upon the waves, halting all control and wreaking havoc on its surfaces. What’s ironic is that the step sequence appears to lack the most control, when in reality the most chaotic segments of his programs would not look the way they did if he did actually lose all control. I cannot stress it enough when I say no one else can skate like him."
Нет ему равных. Это просто чудо.
Все его выступления идеальны... Браво!!!
"I remember watching this live on TV 5 months ago. 

Pure joy. Pure elation. I was ecstatic. 

A masterpiece."
"If you're ever feel bad


About yourself, just remember



Someone need to perform after him"
Yep decided to binge watch his iconic performances after him announcing his retirement. Skating won't be the same without him.
"Thank you for sharing! Yuzuru is some sort of magician... We are entranced from the very first movement, when he slowly moves his head and stares ahead, until the end, when he fiercely opens his arms. Breathtaking performer!"
Simply Magical 💖
La elegancia se personifica en Yuzuru. ❤️❄️👑
I am very happy that he will get to enjoy the ice again free from competition induced pressure.
"1:33 Did you guys notice the beauty of that moment? Synchronized, clean, beautifully done. 2:03 and 3:12 too.. Ahh love.. What a heavenly performance!!! Only Yuzu knows the spell words. MAGICAL✨"
I am so honored to witness Yuzu's flawless short program in South Korea. His jumps with tone like the murmuring stream sound and stsq is as passionate symphony. Yuzuru is the music.  Thanks uploading this masterpiece. It's a little pity no WR.
He’s so beautiful. Honestly. I’ve seen very few skaters that impress me. But he blows my mind every time. I’d love to see him live one day. That would be absolutely amazing. Keep amazing people Yuzuru Hanyu. 😘
Absolutely genius
Some humans are just too extraordinary and transcendent in what they do to be called 'humans'...
This is exactly what we're waiting for!!  THE GOAT!! Can't wait for his new performances of new season!!
FINALLY!!! Thank you so much~~~!!!!!!!
The treasure of all my life.⛸🪽✨
Can you imagine it if Yuzu brings Let's Go Crazy to Pyeongchang instead of Chopin? Purple pants with purple background?
"OMG 😍, absolutely beautiful!! 👏👏👏👏 Does this boy really exist? Yuzuru you are the number 1! I ❤ you!"
Никто его не обыграла даже Пекинская олимпиада
"Chopin was accompanying him at that time, the best short programs among those male figure skaters, also one of his greatest short programs."
"LOL my current profile pic is from this glorious day :P.  There were people sitting in front of me who didn't even know who Hanyu was or what my pooh ears were about.  It was a bit shocking to hear the question ""Who is Hanyu?"" with the Olympics rings right in front of me. But I didn't say much and decided to let his skating do all of the talking, and boy did he do it!   They got quite a lesson, one they'll never forget :P."
Finally! Thanks a million for posting this masterpiece!
"Such a well delivered program; mad artistic interpretation skills there, and the jumps really are integrated parts of the performance. Well done Yuzuru Hanyu! We are blessed to be able to watch this. Thank you Olympic Channel for the video!"
"感動をありがとう
見ごたえがある❤"
I like his suit. He's like an ice prince
"Still a shame that this was uploaded so late. This performance deserves more views. If only it were uploaded around the same time as his long program, then we would be at the millions by now."
Finally 😊💖 Thank you! 🌸✨😊
This is a skate worth generations. Incredible.
Should’ve been given a new record score.
I HAVE DIED...EVERYDAY...WAITING FOR THIS..... FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!~
"Masterpiece. Can’t see any other skaters after watching him, they are too boring, sorry for being honest!"
"До слёз! Красивый, талантливый! Супер!!!❤❤❤"
"jedyny taki, pojechał interpretując  każdą nutkę Szopena...MISTRZ!!!!!!!!!!"
"I don't know why this didn't get a world record!!  Especially witness what happened after the change of scoring system these 2 seasons.  Shame on ISU........They totally destroyed Figure skating!  I don't know how long Hanyu can tolerant all these nonsense and unfair scores.  On one side, I am grateful he still fighting and give us beautiful performance.  On the other side, I wish he can retired because ISU didn't deserve him.  ISU  just uses him as cash cow and keeps insulting him."
自从我学会登录YouTube后，我每天都要来看看羽生结弦的花滑节目，他真的是一位伟大的花滑选手，感谢他为我们带来美好和感动。我永远支持他❤️
10 people have no effing idea of what's the essence in figure skating.
You don't often get to see perfection 😢
"Just here to say that Yuzu is the Greatest Male Figure Skater of All Time.




Happy Retirement Yuzu. I look forward to you opening a chapter as a Pro-Athlete. And I also wish you to finally land the Quad Axel infront of your huge fans."

Yuzuru's basic skating skills are beyond every other skaters ❤️
"Graceful, elegant, fashionable, exceptional music choice, spectacular performance. 🥳🎉❤"
"I'm still here, my chicago, ughh who says sports can be both techniques and art. That 3A he did, that deserves a fcking perfect score,ITS WELL DONE"
와 이때 역대급이었구나 진짜 미쳤네
"Красота,мощь,сила, музыка все вместе -это Юдзуру 💝"
結弦、今まで本当に頑張ってきたねありがとう😭これからも応援していきます結弦の人生に乾杯🌈
Hearing his shoes crashing with the ice makes my heart beating ngl I feel nervous but excited
"素晴らしい
美しい　スケートの中の王子様ですね😊"
I feel so blessed to be one of the audiences in that arena. I still remember the atmosphere on that day. He's the miracle of this sport. True legend
Such great ice interpretation of Chopin.
"The King of figure skating, the GOAT, pure perfection, both technically and artistically, just Yuzuru Hanyu 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
2:39 이건 진짜 볼때마다 신들린것 같아서 '진짜 미쳤다..' 생각밖에 안든다.. 암튼 하뉴 최고 >ㅅ<👍
"going back to this performance after Yuzu announced his retirement from competitive skating. kinda sad i wouldnt see him perform competitively with my own eyes, but overall really just happy he’s free and excited for the next chapter in his career.

forever the goat ❤️‍🔥"
The most beautiful figure skater of all time.

I became a fan of Yuzuru after seeing this performance.
"When you find yourself out of breath and smiling with tears stinging your eyes, you know an artist's greatness has captured your heart."
Above figure skating is Hanyu Yuzuru
2:27 is the beginning of the madness.. truly the GOAT
The boy is divine.
❤ HANYU FOREVER ❗💖💖💖😍👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🌹🌻🌹🌻🌹🌻🌹🌻🇧🇷🇧🇷
Seeing him skating is magical for me.
"I'm so drawn to his skating like gravity, I think anyone who watches this will feel completely absorbed in the moment. hanyu yuzuru's skating is the truth 🙌"
"Isn't it stupid after all that Yozuru has given to this sport that ISU fights him with all the ferocity to push him to retire to live his place for the new generation?
This is unfair. They must themselves prove their worth in front of him and get his place by their own merit, not by favoritism.
Despite their fight against him, Yuzuru will forever remain the icon of skating, the king of ice, and the most popular throughout the history of this sport."
Keep coming back here because it's all so beautiful. He makes it all so beautiful.
There’s a reason why this is one of my favorite pieces and he was able to convey that sense of ethereal sorrow beautifully
definitely an artist on ice. Such a beautiful program.
He deserved 50 points in Presentation 🔥🔥
"This is a work of art that transcends figure skating, it's a sublime statement and expression of the soul, spirit, heart and mind, full of passion, quietness and introspection.❤️⛸️💐💞"
"羽生選手最高の演技を有難うございました。
あなたの勇士は私の誇りです。
色々な苦難を乗り越えあなたは真の王者です。
正しい技術を一貫して貫いた姿はスケートの神様です。"
"何度見ても美しい。✨
そして何度も見たくなる✨"
"Натан не трогает,ничего не чувствую..как дерево катается,только делает ставку на технику,а дальше пустота..
Юдзуру порхает на льду,грация..смотришь с замиранием,как магия какая-то,прыжки как юла,со скоростью света,красиво..он мастер❤❤❤"
"He's the epitome of elegance and gracefulness, a pure joy to watch!"
Yuzuru Hanyu is the legend of legends
Seriously all 3 jumps done with difficult entry 👏🏼👏🏼
"Watching him performing Ballade No.1 is a luxury, I found my eyes glued to his everymove, every fibre to the fingertips, every facial expression. I hear people clapping and cheering, but imagine myself in the stadium, I would not spare  a split second on those. I would simply take in every bit, literally every bit of him into my eyes, engrave them in my mind. My soul is cleansed. Yuzu, you are the best skater in the universe, whereas all other skaters so mundane and dull and boring and despicable."
"the best short program in figure skating history. and the second is rondo capriccioso. always on top, yuzuru hanyu aka greatest of all times"
"完璧
ツィメルマンの演奏に全く劣ることなく、こんなにもバラード1番と溶け合えるなんて"
"Agree this is his masterpiece.  Though the SP from 2014 is fantastic, too.  His landings are sublime."
"This was the first time I watched him skate, been a fan ever since"
하뉴 사랑해
It feels like an unrequited love.. everytime I watch this..
No wonder he aced it....so beautiful! almost unreal. Loved it
異次元の美しさに見惚れてしまいます。
"He is stunning, love him."
青春のえねるぎいの、全てを、心身ともに、金メダルに、費やされた、本物の輝きです。
"yuzuru represents the elegance, technique, aesthetics, interpretation, art, his presentations are just art."
nobody skates as beautiful as yuzuru hanyu.. he is art.. magical 😍😍😍
my number one 
第一次直面结弦，就是这场短节目的直播，我被打动了，太震撼了，永远忘不了当时的情景和心情。很久以前我就知道结弦，可我从没看过他的比赛。很幸运的是我在平昌重新遇见了他，遗憾的是我错过了那么多年。以后的每一天都不会再错过，每一天都会更爱你。羽生结弦，我真的好爱你❤
When it comes to Hanyu there’s no other words that comes to mind than AMAZING AND A LIVING MASTERPIECE!
Someone recommended I check out this piece.. and I can't believe I have never watched him.. he is so graceful and elegant and amazing!!!! love this!!!!
名符其实的冠军，永远的冰上王者真把我给看醉了，太棒了！🥰🥰🥰
"Yuzu really saying no to crossovers 😭😭

He actually just floating actross the ice. Mohawk, turn. 

All of them using one foot skating. Gosh. ❤️❤️😕"
His wardobe is always perfect
"3Aの音ハメよ
ジャンプを表現の一環にしてる感が世界一"
"When Yuzuru skates, I see music,I see art ,I see beauty.He is the GOAT in figure skating.A true living legend."
This is so beautiful that it looks like a wonderful dream... Yuzuru Hanyu is a treasure...💖💎✨
叙叙永远的神！最喜欢这一版和4CC版，什么时候看都令人身心愉快。
신들린 연기.. 스케이트 ...날 ...소리조차 우아함.. 미쳤당 ㅠㅠ
omg its too smooth
"Эта программа Ханю восхитительная и на все времена! Вот где настоящий рекорд, который зажали продажные судьи ИСУ, а не в том надувательстве продемонстрированном в Пекине американцем, абсолютно не попадающим в музыку и все программы бегающим по пустому."
This was so smooth and clear! 😍 I was amazed when he jumped. Definitely breathtaking!!
다시 봐도 참 좋다❤
Best SP performance in my opinion.
YUZURU HANYU beherrscht den Zauber Musik sichtbar zu machen.
他太美了，他的动作和肖邦音乐融为一体，让我深深感动。了解他之后，更被他的坚强，优雅，谦虚、智慧和人格所吸引，他是我惟一喜欢的运动员。
It's been six years🎉
Музыка и танец - это прекрасно.
Come back and watch it in August 2022. I still cannot stop crying.
"nothing ever compares to this, nothing stands close to this absolute masterpiece. i hope he knows he has the greatest legacy ever"
"Guardare altri pattinatori dopo Yuzuru, è  tempo perso."
"This short program made me become a fan of Yuzuru Hanyu, it’s really a masterpiece, I don’t know how to describe but this program can always bring me to a peaceful and emotional
world every time I watch it, my favorite fs program❤️"
It’s too beautiful and too Ethereal!  Every time I want some peace and joy I come watch Yuzu’s skating videos.
this is the absolute best of figure skating
The intro just has Jeffrey Buttle all over it lol. What a master piece made by Jeff and delivered by Hanyu!
What a beautiful skating! Stunningly beautiful! Incomparably beautiful! Immensily beautiful! 💎⛸️💎
いつ見ても、美しいスケート
"magnificent and amazing, no matter how many times I see this"
"Coming back to rewatch this skate after the special talk with Yuzu and pianist Shinya Kiyozuka -- this Ballade SP was one of the programs they discussed --. So fascinating to see two people from different fields coming together through their passion and common love for music <3 Kiyozuka and Yuzu met in FaOI2018 (after PyeongchangOlympics!), when Yuzu picked Haru yo Koi as live collab piece with Kiyozuka (one of the guests artists that year). Later Kiyozuka recorded a HYK version for Yuzu to skate in other galas too, and then he also arranged and played Yuzuru's Rondo Capriccioso (the short program he brought to Beijing2022). Those two get along so well! Yuzuru's love and respect for music shines through his skating. Truly a timeless masterpiece, that no score or accolades can ever fully reward. The real value of Yuzuru's skating is in how it manages to reach people's hearts, and he keeps doing so now as a professional skater too (like A Fkeeting Dream, how a simple cool down can became a piece of art). I can't wait for his next show in Tokyo Dome next February!"
"Elegance on ice, a timeless masterpiece."
He is my favorite male single skater
"The Perfect figure skating,Thank you Hanyu Yuzuru ,the best ever,the legend Thank you"
You are a legend 💙💙💙🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🖤❤️❤️❤️

"足の怪我、顔色の悪さから万全ではないことは明らかだったけど、この張り詰めた緊張感の中でミスがないどころか
魅せる演技ができる所が羽生選手の強さ。プログラムを何倍も輝かせることができる稀なスケーター。"
"Yuzuru Hanyu Ice Story 2nd ""RE_PRAY"" Tour on 4-Nov-2023. Get Global streaming ticket at Beyond Live."

羽生結弦のバラードと浅田真央のノクターンはどちらも、彼らから曲が流れているように見えるほど曲と融合している
I rarely find skaters that connect well and become whole with the music. Yuzuru did that so well🥺
The true WORLD RECORD 👑👑
"This is a beautiful masterpiece, in my opinion it's the best short program ever made, not everything is technical, there is, but the artistic part, the part of personifying each musical note with his body is exquisite.

"❄.•*❄.•*❄ ... Чудной  лентой  вьётся  дым  серебристой  снежной  пыли - под  коньками  у  Hanyu,  что  скользят  узорным  стилем.   Этот  царственный  Шопен, - сотканный  из  нежных  звуков, - до  сих  пор  для  нас  нетленн,  до  сих  пор  для  нас  наука :  как  скользить  без  напряженья,  загораясь  вдохновеньем ... ""вышивать""  на  льду  узор - из  ""Баллады""  соль-минор !.. 
🎆 ~ Царское  величие  ""Баллады""  соль-минор :  в  чём  её  отличие,  в  чём  здесь  форс-мажор ?..   Всей  музыкой  ""Баллады""  под  номером  один, - захвачен,  очарован, - вот  этот  господин ...    Он  уловил  так  тонко,  пронзительно  и  звонко, - Шопена  мелодизм,  явив  свой  артистизм, - окрасив  звуки  пианиста,  что  из-под  клавиш  льются  чисто ... прозрачности  такой  кристалльной - как  струйкой  родника  хрустальной ... 
🎆 ~ Hanyu  Yuzuru :  удивительный,  изящно-грациозный  интерпретатор  классики,  в  лице  Фридерика  Шопена.   Знал  ли  польский  композитор,  живший  более  полутора  века  назад,  что  его  музыка  будет  звучать  ещё  и  ТАКИМ  образом,  а  не  в  концертных  залах  или  в  филармониях ?..   Что  она  будет  звучать  на  ледовых  аренах  Мира, - вызывая  трепет  многих  меломанов,  сидящих  на  трибунах  и,  одновременно,  лицезревших  некое  чудо,  по  имени - ""Тетива  и  Крылья"",  что  по-японски  значит :  Yuzuru  Hanyu ?..   Чудо-фигурист  катал  эту  программу  четыре  сезона  и  каждый  раз  душа  Шопена - вселялась  в  его  душу  мгновенно,  с  первыми  же  тактами.   Каждая  нота  и  каждый  аккорд  проникновенной  музыки, -  отыграны  его  скольжением  на  льду - царственно  и  величаво - с  первых  же  звуков  и  до  заключительного  аккорда.   ""Рукопожатие""  гениев  через  века ... 
как  это  удивительно  и  уникально ..."

"A real Chopin on ice! I mean a real genius of both music and skating.
And I am seriously asking Olympic to remove this item away because Hanyu's program is a truely a perfect art. And I totally agree ISU on changing the rules so as to make this a masterpiece forever that no any younger skater could surpass."
あれから5年🎉
The GOE  was +-3 at this moment and changed to +-5 after this. So its nonsense to say break maybe.
あまりにも簡単にエレメンツをこなすので競技それもオリンピックであることを忘れそうになる
又要去琦玉见他了❤开心🥳
If he perfomed this in Beijing he should have won the Gold for the third time.
He say “I’m back “
Legend
perfect
"His component score was not so great like it was in 2014. If you added 4 whole points to presentation, it would be a whopping 115.68 instead of 111.68. Still goat things though yuzu is ice prince."
"Dios mío que deleite para mis ojos, saludos desde Bolivia capo"
Impecable presentación.felicitaciones.⚘🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

"Okay, Im go ask my daughter to practice this on piano ...lol ,,,,"
精彩的演绎，教科书版标准的跳跃，羽生结弦把男子花滑提升到了艺术的领域，完美诠释了何为冰上芭蕾，可惜，这样顶尖的运动员却在巅峰时期被lsu逼退，还有jsf，不保护自己国家难得的人才，跟在isu后面狗一样的迎合，一起打压羽生选手，isu这种腐朽的组织毁掉了花样滑冰，以后都不会再关注花样滑冰，只看羽生结弦的花滑，isu、jsf等着你们的“剰世”吧。

YO FAVORITE CHOPIN SONG AND ICE SKATER
Kibar zarif şeffaf ama çok güçlü
Muhteseeeeem
羽生结弦的花滑盛世
No entiendo la diferencia de puntuación entre Nathan Chen y Yuzuru Hanyu en el programa corto en sus respectivas competiciones olímpicas de 2018 y 2022 en programa de Hanyu tan perfecto  con la Balada  N1 de Chopin  recibiendo 111 y pico puntos y Nathan 113 y pico este año. Si alguien me pudiera explicar con mayor conocimiento lo agradecería.
"... И только он и тренер знают, чего ему ЭТО стоило...."
今後のフィギュアスケート界においても、羽生結弦しか勝たんのです
✨✨✨✨✨✨
最高のアイスダンス！
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Величайший фигурист! Восторгаюсь им и щас!
This masterpiece phenomenal program helps me clean my eyes😌after watching a crossover-kun/overscore/robot-jumper/empty “WR?”🤨🙃
After retiring ....
"Это очень красиво, просто божественно! Молодец!🤗👍🙏❤️"
Шедевр😍
Waw
It really triggered me how they cut the piece from its best parts.
"I want ask if ISU is satisfied about the result of the 2022 Olympics. How can they try to destroy Hanyu  at all  costs even though the sport itself may be destroyed at the same time? 
Why not try to use Hanyu 's popularity to promote the sport instead?"
You're back here after his retirement announcement 😭
这是我见过最棒的一版《叙一》
이거를 미국 심판이…이경기는 신기록 점수 줬어야지 ㅡㅡ
我们叙一简直perfect
A veces mis pensamientos vuelan muy lejos y me pregunto si Juan Sebatian Bach hubiese contemplado su fragmento de balada en la pista de hielo con la interpretación de Yuzuru.
Günlük dozumuzu alalım. 🤤♥️
nice!

"Sorry por los gringos pero la wea del corto de nathan no se compara a esta pieza completa en todos los aspectos, ya quiten lo artistico y dejen patinaje con saltos q para eso si es bueno su ""campeon"" actual."
All that & he's rumored to be smart & have common sense too.
