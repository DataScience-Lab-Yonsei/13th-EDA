I still can't believe she actually waved to the judges... and then hugged one of them afterwards...
This skater is forever written in sports history as a gold robber
"I've seen both. Can't deny Yuna is much sophisticated, delicated, and has a seamless fantastic transition on each movement."
"Sotnikova was not recognized even though she won the gold medal, and the world recognized Kim Yu-na as the best. This is the most important part."
"I just love how Yuna's video is titled 'Yuna Kim Claims Silver With A Superb Performance' while this is just 'Sotnikova's Gold Medal Winning Performance'. 

The shade."
legendary comedian
"8:12 ""not sure I agree with that""


even the commentators know..."
"Whoever says the gold was rigged,stolen,robbed, unfair
A friendly reminder that




You're all correct"
For those of you who may not understand how inflated her points were — this free program was scored just 0.11 points away from Yuna Kim’s record breaking free program at Vancouver 2010. Honestly such a mockery
Kim Yuna deserved gold. It’s 2019 and I’m still not over this
2020 I’m still angry —- hand over the medal to Yuna
"Sotnikova just said in an interview that her A samples tested positive for doping, but the IOC protected her and her B samples were ""magically"" not positive.  Basically just admitted the Olympic committee and IOC helped cover up her positive doping.  They literally did everything they could to drag her onto that first place podium."
Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge Wrong edge+ half turn pre rotation x10+under rotation x10
Update 2021: still very bitter about it. I'll come back in a year
3:16 이게 어떻게 금메달 수준의 점프가 될 수 있냐 진짜 이런 식으로 편파판정 할거면 지들 나라에서 좋아하는 애들 모아 놓고 메달주기 놀이나 하지 세계적인 경기에서 저딴 식으로 경기 펼치는 사람한테 메달을 주냐 진짜ㅎ 생각없네
"Sotnikova had an incredible skate, one that should have earned her the bronze medal. This should have been the start of her career, an encouraging result that she could have used to motivate herself for the next Olympics. Instead, she won gold, fizzled out, and robbed a true legend the chance to go gold back to back. It's a shame, really."
"*Wrong edge Lutz, Full-blade Toe loop, Step-out Loop, Prerotated Flip, Unclear edge step sequence, Heavy transition. It's her total package.*"
I don’t even skate and even I can see a massive difference between her and Yuna’s skill
와 이게 김연아 레미제라블보다 점수가 높다니...존나 코미디다
1:13 wrong edge 3:14 two foot landing
Quarantine and I'm still angry
"2010 Yuna Kim🥇🇰🇷
2014 Yuna Kim🥇🇰🇷
ISU & Olympics, please apologize to Yuna. It's time to be grown up!"
"6 years already and we’re still furious with this. It’s obvious. 
Sotnikova is just ice skating ,but yuna kim is doing art on ice. 
Continue with your gold. Yuna will always be the gold in our hearts."
She literally DOPED and this was still the best she could do.
"At 5:40, the female commentator said "" This performance is fantastic but did not have the magic"" 
At 8:10, the male commentator said : "" Would you believe she got on the component score as well, I am not sure I agree with that""
She also performed this program in different competitions prior to the Olympics but her scores were far below her scores in the Olympics. Her scores were definitely inappropriately inflated. She had mistakes (wrong edge on the lutz, wrong landings on the triple flip - double toe - double loop combination). I cant believe this performance is 5 points higher than that of Yuna Kim's flawless long program Adios Nonino. The Gold medal truly  belongs to Yuna Kim. 
The IOC should do something about it because a lot of skating fans will lose their trust in the sports. Such a shame."
Sochi will be a forever joke
“little bit of a dance at the finish” girl that was a two footed landing and you know it
"Can't believe judges did that.The whole world curses them for their deed.
Kim yuna will always rule the heart💙
Silver shined brighter than gold"
진짜 김연아랑 격이 다른게 느껴짐;;; 동작들이 겁나 조잡하고 점프후 자세하단가 모션들이 다 싼티남. 어떡해든 점수 많이 받을라고 기술 때려박은 느낌이랄까 ... 김연아 공연을 볼때의 그런 감동이나 우아함이 전혀 안느껴짐
I'd rather loose and come back to compete than win the gold medal and have everyone question my skills and forever compare me to the person they think the gold should have gone to.
연기하다말고 손흔드네 ㅋㅋ 2020년 말에도 열받아서 저처럼 보고계신 분?
still can’t believe this won
"Adelina ROBBER
1. Horrible Flutz
2. Full-Blade used on Toe-Loop
3. Absolutely more than 1/4 pre-rotation on Flip
4. 2-foot landing on 2T and 2 Lo combination

YUNA KIM
Unbelievably perfect and clean performance(no doubt)

How could TES of Sotnikova be higher than that of Asada with 3A????
How could PCS of Sotnikova be nealy equal to Kims PCS"
"I’m sorry I got bored watching her. Yuna has an artistic skill, she absorbs the music into her skating, she has a feel for it. This girl....no she just kinda goes thru the motions"
"Poor ignorant girl, she had potential. If only the score was fair, judges and player(Sotnikova) was clear and honest, she could still do ice skating.
Now she's just disappeared."
Yuna Kim is not just about figure skating. She knows how to connect to her audience. Her every move is an art to behold. ❤️❤️❤️
8:22 “ cant honestly say I agree with that” right after she won 💀💀
"I still cannot relate how this video can come close to the one i saw in Vancouver! Seriously, 149.95???!! Judges must be blind!"
"Anybody with eyes to see would agree Yuna Kim's performance was superior; her grace, artistry, timing was a beauty to behold! It bought tears to my eyes."
"Corruption, in all areas, a real shame. I'm sorry, but you Yu-Na, you will always be the best."
"사년 만에 봤다.
러시아 소치 올림픽의 격을 보여주는 경기같다. 
메달만 따면 그만이라는 경이로운 천박함."
"3:19 ""Little bit of a dance at the finish"". What? Wh-WHAT?"
"After watching this,  I can conclude that Yuna Kim's lost due to one foot landing.  Yuna shld have land on both knees and hands to get the gold medal. I think they forgot to inform all the contestants on the new way of scoring."
Please upload her Sochi gala show🙏 Best comedy video ever🤣🤣🤣
Adelina is good but Kim Yuna was definitely better. It still breaks my heart that she was robbed of the gold medal.
"Oh! so this was one of the issues some of my friends were talking about back then. Truly, Yuna Kim will always be the true champion here."
Still hating on this performance during quarantine. Lol
"It’s 2024 and  seeing this again reminded me of the grace, precision and technique of Yuna Kim. She won the gold but Yuna Kim always get the hearts of gold from Figure skating lovers all over the world. Yuna Kim is a story teller in Ice."
"Watching Kim Yu-na fall to second place, many figure skaters in weak countries must have lost hope. Even the Olympics, which I believed would be the fairest, realized that the pressure of the great powers worked"
"*Face it, Yuna is the TRUE Champion. Adelina made a TON OF MISTAKES and her points were seriously inflated, if you happen to be an idiot who needs education, search on Youtube and they will teach you very thoroughly how Adelina's win was clearly not legit.* Don't say that ""but Adelina was the one who won in the end hAHAHAH"" because honestly, did you guys really not know that the judges were either paid or corrupted? If not, I pity you."
"Im sorry Yuna. Clearly these judges cannot see what we saw.
Thank you Yuna for your career. I loved watching you. You deserved the gm over this performance."
"소트니가 금메달일 수 없는 이유 1.예술성 제로, 로보트가 삐걱거리는 느낌 2.점프 실수(모든 점프가 점프 축이 너무흔들림.. 연아랑 비교가 안됨) 3. 별 볼일 없는 선수를 자국력으로 메달주는 러시아 수준"
"Watched this again, and I just really noticed how biased the commentators are. 

Woman: Triple Flip Double toe, Double loop. 
*sotnikova stumbles the landing*
Woman: Little bit of a dance at the finish.

Little bit of a dance? Seriously. WTH. Still rolling my eyes on this performance."
I've never seen a video of a gold-winning medalist which has views 2m fewer than the silver-winning medalist
"2020, I'm from Russia and I'm still thinking this is an unfair win"
"She performed to the best of only her ability and probably had no idea that she had won a gold medal.
It was an unconscionable competition in many ways and the judges are scum."
"It's YELLOW, not gold!!!"
이 삐걱대는 연기가 진정 금메달이라고...? 진짜 사기다 사기
얘가 왜 금메달을 따게됬나면 얘말고 더 잘하는 어린애 있었음 캔틀 스핀 메탈베이블레이드 처럼 하는앤데 점프뛰다 넘어진거임 그나마 얘가 안넘어져서 얼떨결에 밀어준거 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 저건 잘받아도 200절대 못넘는 연기였음 지금 우리나라 키즈3인방이 하면  저것보다 잘함
The only gold medal in her senior international competition = olympics 2014. We can see clearly how hasty Russia was to robber Yuna Kim’s gold. What a shame
"소트니코바는  
본인 목에 금메달을 건 날 
본인의 피겨 커리어가 끝남
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅆㅂ 2021 다시 봐도 열 받네"
“Not sure I agree with that” ... “but _technically_ I do” bruh ahahah the judge smelt the bullshit
Kim yuna deserve gold
"On 02.22.2022, Sotnikova 3.3 mil and Queen 9.4 mil views. The performance in figure skating ideally should be something that people can remember as art and want to see it again and again. In that regard, we know what was the most beautiful performance was in Sochi."
진짜 악플달기 싫은데ㅋㅋ 소치만 생각하면 빡쳐서 야 누가 피겨를 그렇게 우악스럽게 하냐ㅋㅋ 덤프트럭이 더 아름답겠다;;
"There are okay skaters, there are good skaters, there are great skaters, and then there are phenoms. Adelina is an okay skater at best, but Yuna Kim is undeniably and will continue to be the best skater for as long as history goes. She's a true perfectionist, she's really at another level."
"4:22 4:29
뭐하는거임........? 진짜 선입견 다 빼고 봐도 별로임. 순간순간의 표현력, 연기는 다 빼고 팔 흔들면서 관객 호응 유도하고 두번째 저건 누구한테 인사하는거임 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ공연도중에ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ???? 저것도 연기 중 하나인거임?? 몰입감 완성도 확 깨는데..."
I love that her majesty Queen Kim Yuna's gala performance has more views than the winning freeskate lol
경기 끝나고 오열하며 좋아하는게 개소름...
"I watched this after watching Yuna’s.
This just seems so like, how do you describe it, robotic?
Yuna had so much emotion."
"4:22 She is cheerleading herself LMFAO

She knew she was going to win anyway. And the first thing she did after win was running and hug to the russian judge..."
She was Dopping with judges
It’s been 4 years and I still get so triggered by her winning. Kim Yuna had a perfect performance. I get so emotional watching Kim Yuna’s performance. This girl wasn’t graceful AT ALL and I’m definitely not the only one that has this opinion.
Sotnikova's Gold Medal win was just wrong. Distasteful. Still angry in 2020.
"김연아 제외하더라도 소트니코바보다 잘한 선수들 여럿 있었음, 근데 그들을 제치고 금메달이라니..ㅋㅋ 대단하다 대단해 아주;"
"이 명곡을 이 버전으로 쓰는 것도 놀랍고 안무는 더 놀랍고 의상까지도 놀랍고
골드메달은 더더더 놀랍고  놀라움의 연속"
"Poor girl,
Even after 6 yrs, Almost people do not agree about this performance was got the gold. But this girl celebrate herself the Unfair Sochi Olympics, What a shame."
2021년에도 여전히 이해할 수 없는 연기와 결과...
"Fun fact: If you add 'o' to 'sochi' to make it 'soochi', it means ""shame"" in Korean. Very ironic."
Yuna kim is the real champion. Everybody knows that.
this skater will forever be known as the skater who didn't deserve to win. Yuna Kim was robbed.

"The violence inflicted on Yuna that night was appalling. She was completely alone. Yuna had to fight the judges, fight over a thousand Russian spectators, and fight powerful nations."
3:18Yuna was the gold medalist@!! 🏅
Yuna Kim  is  real  champion.  Everyone knows.
ㅇㄴ 6년이 지나도 빡치네 3:15 저게 어딜봐서 금메달이고 레미제라블보다 점수가 높냐
러시아가 그래도 동계종목이나 발레 나름 강국인데도 2021년에 이 영상을 다시 봐도 도무지 금메달리스트의 연기로 기품이라고는 찾아볼 수가 없구나. 당시에 넘 빡쳐서 저 삐끗한건 그 사이 잊었는데 다시봐도 어이상실.
러시아인들 말고도 일본인들도 눈 감고 귀 막고 어거지로 금메달 맞다고 피의 쉴드 쳤는데 도핑 테스트 양성이라고 떠서 어떡하냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
yuna was a lot better !!!
"She did great but I can't feel any emotions through her and she's like an iron dancing on ice unlike Yuna, she is graceful, you can feel the emotions flowing from her and she's perfect. Yuna should have won the Gold."
"Yuna's performance was lovely, she moved like the wind and I felt moved. I don't feel this here. 
She's stiff compared to Yuna, and her jumps don't match the song at all, and furthermore during the most upbright part of the music she couldn't keep up with it, it seemed out of pace consequently."
"단기간은 속일 수 있지만, 결국 역사가 평가한다."
진짜 이거 금메달 어떻게 못 돌려받나? 또 보니까 열받네
Adelina Sotnikova is the only olympic champion who has NEVER WON the top three at the World Championships and Grand Prix Finale.
진짜 지금봐도 언제나 화가치밀어오름ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
솔직히 김연아도 김연아지만 소트니코바의 결과는 아사다마오 밑이여야했음
How the hell did she win gold? She landed on 2 feet for goodness sakes! Anyone who would have made that mistake would have not even made top 3 and this girl won first? Those  Russian judges are too biased and didn't even give her a single deduction. Hmmm.... Wonder why. Yuna should have won first and Carolina second. I don't even think she deserved third place.
3:18 this is gold???????????
3:16 if you want to see the two foot landing
Mao Asada's step sequence is better than this whole performance combined 😂
"she looks like she is going to fall at anytime! the gold medal didn't bring her pride, it has brought her mocks and negative views from the world.. she is talented (at the age of 17) but honestly I think Kim Yuna skated clean and steady throughout her round.. this incident has cast a dark shadow on her career as people will always doubt her gold medal.. Kim Yuna should've win.."
We know who is the real gold medal winner... Right guys? It's Yuna Kim!
i don't like her because she criticized yuna and walked out on yuna and kostner and all the reporters/ cameras during the medalist interview. she has no common sense and no manner.
Bro how are going to admit yourself that your sample tested positive? 😂🤣😂🤣🤣 and Russian officials only confirming that her sample wasn’t scrutinized because Shvetsky (the team doctor for the 2022 skaters in Beijing and close affiliate of Eteri…) was working with the skaters instead of Rodchenkov 🤡
it's 2019 and this still makes me mad.
Give Yuna her gold medal.....
The gold medalist who won by two foot landing! Amazing 😻
4:28 shake hand to judges
"She didn't only robbed Yuna's gold, but also Carolina and Gracie's silver& bronze medals"
Literally nowhere near the expression of Yuna Kim.
4:22 Is she a commedian? 개웃기네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The gold belongs to Yuna.
저런 경기를 하고 어떻게 눈물을 흘리지
TWO FEET ON THE LANDING AND SHE WON THE GOLD MEDAL??? REALLY??? I DON'T BELIVE...
Obviously this was a beautiful program by itself. No one can deny that she had immense talent. But are you seriously telling me that this beat Yuna? Because it didn't. Yuna's program was and always will be superior
"이미 금메달을 예상 한 것처럼
연기내내 들떠서 관중한테 손 흔들고..
투풋랜딩을 하고도 저런 행동이 나올 수 있는지 너무 의아한…."
The mere thought of comparing this girl's 'okay' performance to the Queen's flawless and gracious FS performance is insulting.
3:15 Here to see Legendary two foot landing. I heard that's the secret way to win the gold medal haha.
"Even looking it again after a few years, it feels like seeing a machine that is broken and creaking."
"To think that this program beat her Le Mis Program... absolute clownery. Yuna was the winner of everyone's hearts that tragic night. And now almost a decade after, she admits to having a positive sample... you couldn't even get near Yuna even with drugs in your system..."
Sochi Olympics 2014's figure skating is the best comedy show I've ever seen.
"I can see the flutz, underrotated and two foot landed jumps so clearly. She's just 21 even after 4 years, why doesn't she compete anymore? The funny thing is, this was her one and only Gold throughout her entire senior career."
삐걱삐걱 깡통로봇같은게 무슨 금메달ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"best part of this video @8:13 ""not sure if I agree with that...can't honestly say I agree with that but technically I do"""
Yuna Kim was robbed
"3:17 3:17 Wow. Is this gold...??!?

4:22 4:22 What is she doing??;;;

4:58 4:58 Why are you crying??🤣

8:12 8:12 Even the commentators know..."
*This* is the performance that was given gold over Kim Yuna’s? The judges should feel embarrassed.
"Абсолютно несправедливое золото. Программа и фигуристка - такие же незапоминающиеся, как платье. Никто её не знал за два месяца до олимпиады и исчезла она моментально, даже на ЧМ не поехала."
The real champion is Queen Yuna
"Sotnikova is a great skater and put up a really good performance here, but I remember being really surprised at her 149.95. I admit I don't watch skating often (only the Olympics) and am a little fuzzy on how they come up with scores, but I do remember Yuna getting her 150 for gold in Vancouver and from a layperson's perspective I didn't feel that this performance from Sotnikova came so close to matching that one."
4:29 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ심사위원들한테 인사하누 여유오져버리네
"It was a lovely fifth place effort, which would've been a huge improvement over her results from the previous world championships."
"I still don't understand how this performanve received 74.41 in pcs, while Mao Asada didn't even reach 70 in pcs"
Still salty about this in 2018
"Adelina: Two foots, flutzes, under rotates, pre rotates, level 2 junior step sequence. Judges: YASSSSSSSSSS +3 goe! 10.0 PCS!!!"
"01:14 3Lz Wrong edge  + 3T Under rotation😱
03:08 Russian judge’s rhythm🫢
03:17 Two foot 😂"
YUNA KIM is the real champion..
"2 years later and I'm still salty over the fact that Yuna Kim was robbed.
So many technical errors. How did she win first"
It's honestly soo hard to find a positive comment about Adelina Sotnikova 😂😂
"This was a shameful moment of sports when silver shined brighter than gold, or rather when gold didn’t shine AT ALL."
러시아의 흑역사 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아 삐걱대서 볼 수가 없어 지 혼자 신나서 난리노
"i can't believe she won ... lol i watched her at the gala where she did a prop (some sort of drappery ... thing) routine and it was such a trainwreck, seriously watch it! ... when i realized that this skater got higher grades than Yuna i sort of blanked a little and then when i realized that she and the gala girl were one of the same ................... you keep shining the only gold you'll get love (although it's the judges fault, how she carried herself after her win and during the press conference when she walked out while yuna was talking is was completley rude ... such a bad sport)."
"overscore....Originally, Sotnikova didn't deserve to be olymoic champion. Look at her scores before and after sochi olympics!!"
Not her admitting she tested positive for doping. Can we give Yuna Kim her rightly deserved gold medal
"아 진짜 개웃기닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
소련놈들 양심이 지지리도 없구낰ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
얘 끝나고 왜 우는거임? 진짜 지가 잘했다고 생각해서 우는거임??????"
"In the backstage, Sotnikova was captured hugging with one of the judges that helped her get the gold..so fair!"
이게 왜 내 알고리즘에 뜨는거지? 몇년이 지난 후 봐도 정말 재밌다.. 정당한 심사를 받았다면 2위도 못 했을거야.. 난 러시아인들도 알고있을줄 알았는데 ‘그녀가 더 잘했다’ 이러고있는거보고 충격..
얘가 금메달인건 백년이 지나도 천년이 지나도 인정할 수 없어.. 부끄러운 승리를 가져간 소트니코바
"I think she has great skills and it looks good for me. However, I can't feel any emotion from her moves.... I feel so bad for other skaters had lower score even though their expression was so beautiful."
네 다음 형광나방ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 러시아인들은 부끄러운 줄 알아야지 쉴드 존ㄴ나 쳐대네;
Shame on her. History and Justice will judge her one day.
이건 아사다마오 의견도 들어봐야한다ㄹㅇㅋㅋㅋ
I strongly think that they chose a wrong person for the gold medal.
This was actually a bronze medal performance but the ISU inflated her scores....
It’s such a bad thing for Sotnikova as well. Her performance wasn’t the best but enough for her to get bronze medal. Could’ve been a honored Bronze Medalist but now she became one of the most disgraceful and comical Gold Medalist in the history of Winter Olympics. What a shame
Yuna wins!!!!
The one thing you have to know is that a lot of successive gold medalist won the competition without many jumps than silver medalist. The Important thing is not the quantity but the quality of jump.
"몇년이 지나고 모든 분노와 빡침 사적인 감정을 내려놓고 다시 돌려봤다. 
확실히 힘있는 스케이팅이었고 파워풀하면서도 물흐르듯 잘 진행한 편의 프로그램이었음. 그러나 클린프로그램은 아니었고 점프도 아쉬운 점이 보였으며, 관객호응유도는 우승할만한 프로그램의 요소가 아니었음. 몇번을 다시봐도 우승은아님."
"A Robot... just that. Without a doubt Yu-Na, she is the best."
"Sotnikova did do a good routine and skated well. But the mistake she made showed that she fell short of the champion mark. 

I learnt how graceful this sport is through Kim Yuna's performance & I don't see much of this in Sotnikova's performance. Her performance was more technical & mechanical than it was aesthetic and graceful. 

Skating is an art and should not be won over merely by technics. I still believe Kim Yuna should have gotten her second gold. "
04:28 뇌물 먹인 심판한테 손 흔드냐? 연아는 발레 느낌이면 얜 관절고장난 로보트 느낌
It’s amazing there are more dislikes than likes 😂 YUNA WAS ROBBED I SAY ROBBED
"Sotnikovas amazing and i cant doubt it, but its so easy to see how much better Yuna is in, well, everytning overall."
진짜 볼때마다 너무 ㅈ같아서 숨이 턱턱 막힌다 ;;
"Is she the one who had a big delightful hug with a Russian judge right after winning? The Russian judge looked soooo delirious as if her real daughter won the gold medal. Well, I can imagine which judge gave Yuna disastrous scores. I bet at least 3 judges were involved in dirty conspiracy."
3:18 YUNA is the true gold medalists.
10년이 다 되어서 도핑인거 스스로 인정하네 ㅋㅋ 이젠 다 제자리 찾아갔으면..
Look at that camera angle of adelina's opening jump!!!! They knew she was going to flutz so they attempted to conceal it with that sideway angle!!! So dirty.
진짜 각목 인형같이 딱딱하게 움직인다 피겨선수가 무슨 팔 한번 들었다 놓는것도 물흐르듯이 못하냐 예술성 0
역대 최악의올림픽 ㅋㅋㅋ 지들만의 리그... 메달따고  바로 튀기 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Can you believe that this score is higher than Yuna's Les Miserables? I'm throwing up.
2:27 초부터 35초쯤까지 로봇인줄 알았네;ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ진짜 클린경기도 아닌주제에 어떻게 메달을 강탈해갈 생각을 하냐 스텝도 꼬이고 스핀할때 팔동작할때 어디에서도 우아함을 찾을수가 없다...
Is this gold medal!!!!!????? Still i can't understand.
The worst olympic champion in figure skating history. Adelina Sotnikova didn't judge. It was not her fault. BUT she was shameless in her interview after Sochi.
"😅 The Russians stole many gold medals in Sochi. Some are because of doping. These gold medals can be withdrawn. However, if some gold medals are stolen like this, it is difficult to get them back, but everyone will remember who is the real champion"
She is technically impressive and amazing elevation as the commentator said. I am happy as the commentator said that Sotnikakova is fantastic and amazing.Well its true and she deserve the gold medal.
Kim Yuna is the true gold medalist. Sochi was so much corruption. PERIOD.
"OMG, this GOLD medal is gonna destroy her career, you know, ppl around her might regard her as a real champion. Unfortunately, she should know the truth that GOLD wasn't for her. (SIGH..."
"Positive doping test, prerotation, double foot landing, technical wrong Lutz, underrotated jumps, no flow and somehow the judges did not see it... This was definitley not gold worthy."
"Why do people keep trying to fool themselves by saying she earned gold? One of the judges was married to the HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN SKATING FEDERATION. Another of the judges had been disciplined years before for trying to fix and event. She even hugged one of the judges when she won gold. I'm sorry, but she did not deserve gold. ﻿"
"This is inconceivable , it should be the Eighth wonder of the world from now on. With all those mistakes, she still got the gold, what a miracle here…"
This whole program was a mess. The costume even started to unravel at the end. It's a mess of jumps and spins. She deserved bronze
3:17에 투풋랜딩 ㅋㅋ
진짜 금메달이 누구였는지는 전 세계가 암
Her performance was a disaster compared to Yuna's which was flawless. So disappointing.
not even close to gold
"Как вот это выступление может быть лучше чем ""Les Miserables"" (2013 worlds Yuna Kim)🤔🤔🤔"
is this step sequence (4:00)  level 4?  are you serious?
6 years already and still no justice for Kim Yuna.
"Ironically, this gold medal was probably the worst thing that could have happened to her. She couldn't live up to the pressure that this medal created. People have HIGH expectations for you if you become an Olympic champion and they were expectations she could never live up to. Had she won the silver or bronze, that would have been a springboard for her to improve from and whilst I don't think she would have ever been considered an all time great, I do believe she could have had a decent enough career, perhaps getting some silver/bronze medals here and there, maybe even a gold if she'd improved enough.

Every time she came out to skate after the 'win' she looked worse and worse and the more she skated, the more damaged her reputation became and the more obvious it became that she was nowhere near an Olympic gold medal worthy skater. I wouldn't be shocked to be honest if she had been forced to quit to stave off the embarrassment and for Russia to try and move on from it completely."
"She is for sure energetic... but HOW???? With those mistakes???? Yuna's performance was perfect and moving, I don't understand how judge works now"
These comments are absolutely dragging her and I'm here for it LOL
She have the medal but Yuna is the real gold. 🏆
"Omg😱 look at this~two  foot landing,  wrong edge. . .real champion?????? BAD😳😨😱😡🤬"
I still watch her performance when i wanna laugh aloud🤣
The gold should've been Yuna's not yours.
03:14 - 03:19 she messed up bad and still got the gold medal? tf is wrong with the judge
She is the one who has to realise that she never deserved the gold medal. That is the result of this Olympics.
"Russia is really crazy, this woman has a gold medal but Elizaveta Tuktamysheva doesn't. Real podium:
🥇 Yuna 
🥈 Carolina 
🥉 Gracie"
"I almost cry every time i watch this. How could this beat Yuna? Ya, Yuna had one less triple but, Adelina had a flutz, so that would make Yuna's base score higher. But even if im wrong, I know one thing is sure, Sotnikova's component score is an outrage. Has Figure skating fallen this much? Does waving to the judges ensure an Olympic win? maybe, but we all know Yuna's performance, as well as Sotnikova's performance needs to be analyzed again. Am I right?"
2017... still salty and I didn't even see one stable landing. And I'm not sure what that was but it wasn't dancing. And wow the commentators couldn't be more obvious about being biased
예술성이라고는 찾아볼래야 찾아볼 수도 없고 ...서커스마냥 기교부리듯 점프만 뛰느라 정신이 없고..저런게 무슨 금메달
역사에 남을 부끄러운 금메달
아니 몇년지난 지금 다시봐도 왜 금메달인지 모르겠네.. ;;
Kim Yuna definitely should have won. This performance wasn't bad but was way over scored
Kim was robbed 😭
주니어선수가 얘보다 두배세배는 더 잘해 진짜야ㅋㅋ
"Legendary comedian ""Mandelina Sotnischenko"" skates to ""bloody armpit but didn't blame my rusty razor"""
I prefer Yuna's performance. This one is kind of dull and not that artistic.
Just laughing... gold with two foot landing..
"In 2022, i still can't believe (3:18) how this ugly step came from legendary gold medalist in Sochi"
삶이 지치고 힘들때 힘내기 위해서 꼭 봐야 하는 영상입니다. 그 어느 코미디 프로그램보다 웃긴 영상입니다. 형광나방 소트니코바는 인류최고 개그우먼🤪
That was dope. If you know what I mean...
Correct Ranking: 1. Yuna Kim. 2. Carolina Kostner 3. Gracie Gold
Shame on you. I don't feel anything from her.
"Проходи эта олимпиада не в России , не заняла бы она 1 место."
"It's not the fact that Yuna is better than this girl like she is a whole another level, this russian girl is really bad. Can't believe Yuna missed the gold medal to this girl who probably wouldn't be able to even get a medal if it was performed in another country. I am very disappointed Russia."
"Even if you totally disregard Yuna's being more difficult and beautiful, take a look at 3:16 , i don't think a gold medal can be won with an error like that. I didn't see any of this during Kim YunA's performance. -.-"
"It would've been so much more amazing had she gotten the bronze, like a more heartfelt story. Mao and Yulia underperforming and then Sotnikova comes under everyone's radar unnoticed and grabs that medal. The world would've loved her and she might have had a more successful career afterwards. Winning that gold tainted her image so much more than it helped because everyone knows how fake it was. Really a shame."
Yuna was the objective champion. Anyone who says otherwise is deeply in denial.
International Skating Union?? Oh sorry I guess you said RUSSIAN Skating Union
4:22  워워워🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ 혼자 신남ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Robbed Yuna Kim! 🇰🇷
Shame on Olympic
Terrible fake olympic champion.

"김연아가 진정한 여왕이죠.

나라면 얼굴 못들고다닌다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Extremely disgusting
ㅎㅎ 무슨 금메달리스트가 실수가 나온데? 짜리몽땅 무슨 곡예하는거같음. 연아는 예술임
Her step sequence was so sloppy I'm cringing
다른걸 떠나서 세번연속점프 착지에서 실수했는데 왜 금메달이지   스핀돌때징그러
I hope she knows she didn't deserve it
10년 다되가는데 여전히 열받네
"She did very very well in her best ability. But she is an ordinary skater, Yuna is an extraordinary skater. That is the difference in my opinion."
"I mean im not gonna say Adelina is an awful perfomer but I do believe that her score does not reflect her ability as a skater. Like her Gala show performance, her routines were very powerful and energetic but they were also very shallow. Really mechanical and choppy.. I dont see much emotion from her performance. Just Adelina herself and her skills. Nothing else. She definitely had home ground advantage as the crowd clapping along the music and Adelina herself waving and smiling at them. That looked unprofessional to me. It almost made me feel like i was watching some high school talent show 😂😂"
"She's skating like a robot, very far from Yuna Kim, Yuna's skating with her soul ❤💃🏼 it's absolutely different level."
Give the gold back.
우선 클린이 아니잖슴!!! 클린이 은메달이고 클린 아닌 사람이 금메달인건 뭔 코미디여ㅋㅋㅋ149.95 개오반뎈ㅋ
"She's incredible, she really is, denying the fact that she's got talent is stupid but Yuna stays the winner for me and deserved the gold more. Plus, it was really rude of her to walk out while Kim was still doing her interview..."
"I cannot belive why she is gold.. Yuna Kim is even better than her. Her spin and jump are all perfect, but I cannot find any emotion in Sotnicoba. Her jump was not perfect it was just normal skater, not athlets"
I watched both Yuna and her performances many many times! Definitely Yuna was the best and Queen!! The scandal stole the gold medal from Yuna! Shame!!!
"If any Russian was to win, it should’ve been Lipnitskaya. Amazing and deserving. I’m so sorry Yuna 🥺 you deserved 1st place ❤️"
"She was overscored plain and simple. She deserved Silver but not Gold. Yuna's was flawless and she was underscored. It just wasn't as good as Yuna, this really makes me question the Olympics."
She wasn't even 0.0000001% close to Yuna's performance. Yuna deserved that gold and Russians robbed her of that.
The most shocking is she on par with Yuna in PCs😅  so crazy robbery
3:16 two foot landing
that's unfair. she landing with two foots. what a fool. real gold is Queen YUNA.
어쩜 이리 뻣뻣할까...
Is she Ssibal-Nyun?
"Her lutz is wrong edge..  is she technically strong? NO! she had some mistakes such as twofoot landing and step out. Her PCS is too high. Althoug she is olympic champion, She doesn't have any world medal and gpf medal. She should prove her ability."
"While Yuna Kim is still revered as a legendary female figure skater, Sotnikova is remembered as some joke or worse, a symbol of a medal fraud."
Not hating when I say this but... Where are did the deduction points go judges?
3:18 Is this the real skill of a gold medalist??😂😂
"She almost fell and she got a gold medal, well maybe I can't understand to judge this expertly .... but kim yuna's I think she showed all smooth art performance to the audience and judges. But I think sotnikova was amazing, she was young enough to achieve great things. But I hope I can see fair international competition soon."
"럿츠 롱엣지랑 투풋랜딩 감점 다 어디로 갔누

"Her views increasing cause of criticism, Yuna's views increasing cause we wanna see the beauty of figure skating."
"3:18 암것도 모르는 나도 딱보이는데..저게금메달??
쟤는 끝나고 해냈다는듯이 감격하네"
This is such an insult to Olympic spirit. Give the gold back. 6 years passed and still annoying
"I saw you floundering.
This is the gold medalist!😂😂😂"
"I remember watching it and when she finished the program I knew that she was probably to win the Olympics. When I saw her monster score then I was already sure she was the champion. And that is where I started to feel the immense sadness. Not only because I knew that even if Yuna skated a mistake-free long program, she didn''t get a new world record score (over 150 points), - she didn't even get a near world record score in the short program a day before. But because I felt that she had not a chance to win this event. Also because I knew that it was her last ever competition, and when she finished the program then that was the last moment when we saw her as a competitive skater.
Sotnikova did great under huge pressure in Russia, and I respect her for that. She delivered. But I just wish Yuna had won and would be now a two-time Olympic champion. If anyone deserves to be a double champion of our new generation, she is the only one who deserves this. Russian girls will dominate in the next one, or two Olympics anyway. Yuna could have won in Russia, and a Russian could win in Korea 2018."
"3 victims here, 1. Yuna kim for not getting the deserved gold. 2. this Russian kid who could've become some great skater herself one day but for getting that ever so suspicious gold and ending her career at 17 years old. She may be a hero in Russia but in the figure skating world and in the Olympic history she will be talked about in such negative memories FOREVER. 3. the ISU, letting the greedy old judges take control of the sport and ruin it all in front of world audience who are the potential figure fans. ISU is going down again, I hope they get kicked out of Olympics soon. Until then, RIP Figure world, Figure skating is dead to me now. "
ㅋㅋ 스텝도 연아선수에비해 너무 비교되고 두발 랜딩인데 무슨 금메달ㅋㅋㄱ
Its my first time seein skate olympic and without doubt yuna kim is the winner.
Yuna Kim DESERVED GOLD.
"LOL the dislikes on this video. I don't really understand figure skating, coming from a country that doesn't participate in winter olympic and all but I rooted for Kim Yuna because she seemed to be one with the ice, a truly ice princess. Sotnikova made figure skating lost its beauty. She was all technical and definitely missed the beauty of it. Comparing her to Yuna is like comparing a programmed robot to a passionate human, she as the robot. Her jumps were great, but not pretty somehow. Whatever it is, congrats to her. It's not her fault the judges decided to give the medal to her. Blame the judges but not her. "
"This gold medal is not good for Sotnikova's future. 
She has no future anymore,  because she had  shame gold medal by poor performance. Her performance was much worse than Gracie Gold in Sochi olympic.
She is exactly worst gold medalist in olympic history."
The poorest Gold Medal program
혼자 북치고 장구치고 다 하네ㅋㅋ 혼자 신났네 ㅉㅉ
"I love how she said in her interview after gold medal she said, ""I will compete in every major competition""  then after few months later she decides not to attend the Worlds just because it's not held in her country....  She's just a dodgy character...."
저 실력에 감동받아서 우는것좀봐
금멧닰 반낪햇 잇앿쟁잇년앗!
"To think this performance came to within 0.11 points of Kim's mesmerising, epoch-making 2010 Vancouver FP just makes me laugh. A half-baked, junior display that wouldn't even have got her into the top 10 in any other competition.


Poor girl, she'll forever be remembered as one of the most undeserving champions in figure skating history. If she had any conscience and self-respect, she should apologise and hand over the gold medal to Yuna Kim."
"Triple lutz (FLUTZ) - triple toe underotatted. Where are the deductions for that if you look at the results details judges scores?
After more than two years I still have not digested his victory...I watched his programs several times, trying to convince me that she deserved it, but sorry...figure skating is my biggest passion, but when I see corruption like that in this sport, I feel disgusted. Yuna Kim scored 78,50 in Vancouver for the short program, and 74,92 in Sochi. According to me, if you compare the two performances, there is no reason to be scored under the points she scored in Vancouver. Adelina scored 74,64, only 0,28 under Yuna. The two young ladies skated clean. There is no doubt, the skating of Yuna is more complete than Adelina, for all the time and especially for this competition, in the short and in the long. This is CORRUPTION, shame on it. Adelina derserved third or fourth place. According to me, the randing should be like this: 1. Yuna 2. Carolina 3. Adelina. One day I hope we will take away his medal to make her what she deserves. It does not matter if I like or not Adelina, she is an awesome skater pretty well talented, but justice must be done."
역사상 최악의 승부조작.
NO ONE REMEMBERS HER 😢😢 but we know she STOLE the GOLD 😂😂😂
진짜 이건 ㅅㅂ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 언제 봐도 존나 웃기다... 진짜 로봇 같애 개처웃겨 얘가 금메달을? 걍 웃김 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아오 ㅋㅋㅋ
"I'm still surprised she was able to get gold. I guess it was because she had a lot of jumps in her program, giving her more technical points. But she two footed the double loop and stumbled a bit. She sure can jump high though..."
"We know who the real winner was. Oh, Olympics. Such a disgrace. 🤦‍♂️😂🤣"
4:20 the bird flapping into my window at 6:00 am in the morning
"The whole world know that Yuna won. Russia risks its reputation to give this poor Russian girl a Gold. She ended up being hated around the world. This is a short lived victory for the Russians and a huge defeat to Russia's status in the world.

The poor girl, her future is looking rough, oh the humanity. "
The funniest moment in Olympic Winter Games ever 🤣
"What a huge GOLD MEDAL THIEF!
04:28 Thank you judges for giving me nonsense scores!!"
"Only Kim Yuna gold medal
Russian comedian."
스텝할때 엣지 다 뭉개지는거보소
"Very technical, no artistry whatsoever. I don't feel confident to judge whether or not she deserved the medal, but this was so insanely boring and lacking emotion."
"When Yuna skate she looks like a snow flake
When Adelina skate she looks like a snow ball..."
ten years later and im still shocked this scored higher then yunas les miserables performance
Anyway...What is she doing now? ..just disappeared since after 2014 and we will never see her again cuz she is not a queen like queen yuna from the beggining.
Wow it's funny that this 'gold' winning performance gets disliked more than the likes. Haha
"For robbing Yuna's gold, Sotnikova you will be remembered as the thief who stole queen's gold forever."
still can't believe Yuna didn't win-
점프 실수한 사람도 금 딸수 있구낰ㅋㅋㅋ
worst program I've ever seen as an Olympic gold medalist
각기춤 잘봤습니다.
The worst misjudgment of the Winter Olympics and violation of the Olympic spirit
Winning performance doesn't mean best performance 
Two feet landing and wrong edge..that is clear evidence that you are not a champion
It's sad that the gold medal winning performance was not the gold medal deserving performance.
She should not have been assigned the gold medal. This is a travesty.
"I'm Korean and I'm Yuna Kim's fan too. When I watched this game, because I was rooting for Yuna Kim, I couldn't see the game objectively. I watch it now and although I don't have much knowledge about figure skating I can say that Adelina earned the gold medal. Her performance is amazing. She has more energy and expression in her program. She skated out of joy and her best. On the other hand, Kim's performance was a little cautious and monotonous. I read other posts about techinicality. Maybe, she performed more difficult skills too. Real sportsmanship involves accepting the results for the game and Yuna showed it perfectly. So, don't argue over this. Both athletes did great!"
She lost a chance to be a glorious silver medalist because of Russian's greed.
"I feel bad for her... oddly... wouldn’t it be sad to know that you “won gold” but that you didn’t really... and that everyone thinks you’re a fraud?  I mean.  She deserved Bronze, perhaps.  It’s just sad!"
How did this became a Gold Winning Performance?
She didn't deserve it
"this isn't whether Yuna got the gold medal. She has one already. This anger is because Adelina's score should never have been 0.11 points from the world record. Flutz, two foot landing (and if you would call that a jump, even), under-rotation and plain bad attitude. To have her represent the skating world... SIGH. btw, who the heck waves at the judges... "
"Just for all the people who are calling out the ""haters"". When you have a video with almost 175k viewers with about 80% of viewers not liking what they see or what happened, it's not called hating, it's called the truth. Just like how everyone thought Rebecca Black's Friday was absolutely ridiculous, it's clear by the videos like bar that Sotnikova's Gold Medal performance is just as hideous. It's one thing for trolls to hate stuff, but you can't say that when you have these many dislikes on a god damn Olympic figure skating performance."

Almost 2020 and Yuna Kim was still robbed.
3:18 what was that? I’m not an expert in ice skating in fact i know nothing about ice skating BUT her performance are so out of place. Lots of “jumping” and unclean landing. *sorry for my bad terms* 😅
"anyone here after she admitted to doping, yet the ISU refused to do anything?"
싫어요가 좋아요의 2배를 넘음 ㅋㅋㅋ
Except herself no one seems to be responsible for her not deserving gold. She has to acknowledge of that.

"The fact that this has more dislikes than likes... and she won gold .  Wow, biggest joke in Olympics😂😂"
"Someone commented before that Yuzuru Hanyu fell but still got a gold medal and asked why we don't condemn his winning.  Well, right before the Olympics, he won gold in GP Final.  He won gold in the Olympics.  Right after that, he just won gold in the World Championship.  Where is Sotnikova's gold before the Olympics?  Where is she in the World Championship?  Hanyu has proven his gold-worthy performance, 3 times in a roll.   Where has Sotnikova went hiding after the Olympics?  Bahahahaha!  Everyone says she is only 18 and still very young.  Well Hanyu is 19 and also still very young!"
Her step sequence was disturbing
"skated like a stick, landed her jump on two feet, and won gold. ridiculous."
"Very good, and I would even say that it was close to Yuna's technically, but Yuna's was cleaner and more polished.  She was over scored in her short program.  Otherwise, she wouldn't have won."
세계인들이 인정하네 연아퀸
Level 4 for that step sequence is an absolute joke.
정말 객관적으로 보려했는데 우아함이라곤 1도 없다
"Her performance looks so bland, yuna has more charisma and power"
"It's amazing what corruption can do. It's not her fault that she was awarded the gold, but the medal fiasco definitely left a stain on her career. The judges have no one to blame but themselves."
"Sotnikova, just hand over the gold medal to Yuna Kim... how long is it going to take you to understand this? And where is she now? Hiding? idk"
she won this game with the help of judges but lost everything afterward. She took more than she deserves
YUNA WAS ROBBED
dark side of russian olympic   result: adelina ends her career with full of shamefulness on her fake medal
아디오스 노니노 보고 이거 보니까 끝까지 못보겠냐 왜케.. 후 내 안의 화가 샘 솟을 때 불 지피는 영상 중 하나
Adeliona did her best but Yuna Kim did much better
Gold Thief
All jumps are unpolished and messy. No quality at all unfortunately.
"Btw, propaganda or hatred towards Russia? Go compare the likes and dislikes of this video to Evgeny Plyushchenko's video. If people hated Russia so much, shouldn't his video also be full of dislikes? But it's almost opposite way around of this video where he has way more likes than dislikes? Why? Because majority of the people give respect to the talent where it's due. People give him respect for his talent and his performances. But majority of the people don't give respect to lack of talent that won through corruption."
This inspired me to buy the lottery because I learnt even the most undeserve can still get gold.
"Adelina deserved the gold in sochi.  She out skated Yuna in the lp.  More energy, technical content.  

She didn't not earn it.  "
Shame on you.
"She won! hahaha, what a joke...."
"It's not that this was bad, exactly. A little boring. But not that bad. It shouldn't have been gold."
5:32 겨드랑이나 씻고와라 빡치네

Is that what we calling it now? 🤔"
"Wrong edge and under rotation
You do not deserve the gold."
Is this gold medal? Cant believe it. I feel like im watching a circus show 😂
good performance^^ gold medal thief :)
"Short skate. Impressive score? Huh?

1. Kim Yuna, South Korea, 74.92 (Q).
2. Adelina Sotnikova, Russia, 74.64 (Q).

There was no Russian among the Officials during the short program. Still, Sotnikova's score was as high, as Kim's. How can you explain this? I repeat - NO RUSSIANS among judges during the short program. While there was one judge from SOUTH KOREA (say hi to Kim), another one from JAPAN (say hi to Asada ). Also from Great Britain, Switzerland, Italy (2 of them - say hi to Carolina), Germany, USA (oh, really?), Canada, Sweden. I guess these countries are not ""East European"" and are well protected from Putin's pressure. So how it happened that they all put a very high score to Sotnikova?
And i say same.
Kim did same program, what she did in 2010. Nothings new after she left Brian Orser"
She was so oversocored!!!! worst worst worst worst worst olympic figure skating history

"Even Youtube disabled the dislike button , we still know *She is Cheater*"
"Ice coverages are not good, she stopped skating for almost 17 sec from the start, didn't skating for a while in the meddle. Looks fast, but if you see the naked eye you can know who's speed was better. Also,some of  her jumps are not in good quality (wrong edge, two foot landing) and her step sequence should not have gotten the level 4. Before that, in her program her technical score was too high considering her jumps were 3T-3T. Technically and artistically, she was not the top that night, even the night before."

Shame. Olympics should be changed

"04:28 Let's wave to the judges, it might make them push the plus 5 button!"
She should have been 4th
The biggest robbery ever!
"Taking out the commentary, which obviously favors Adelina (mainly due to her jumps), as well as the home crowd advantage, it’s hard to believe that this performance was better than Yuna Kim‘s for the gold medal. 

Yuna skated cleanly and gracefully.  Adelina jumped impressively, but otherwise skated as if she knew this was hers to win.   

I don’t consider myself to be anywhere near an expert on figure skating.  I’ve always not been following the sport for a few years.  But even I can see the difference between the way Adelina skated here and how Yuna skated. 

Yuna should’ve won the gold.

Aloha ⛸🤙🏼"
Guys its 2024 december 14 and i am still holding a grudge
It's been 10 years and still this audacity infuriates me
"So this almost identical routine to the one she performed at the FGP had a 9 point difference and also landing on two feet in a combination of her jumps, and that made her worthy of the Gold?
I don’t want to defend Yuna, because clearly she didn’t have the skating skills she had in Vancouver and was encouraged by her committee to participate, however she was still top level for 2014, her routine only got 2 more points, if the other skaters had flaws and she didn’t, she was clearly still at the level for the Gold, she had no SIGNIFICANT flaws, her jumps were all excellent, her step sequence and spins were level 3, it’s impossible that with level 4 spins or step sequence you win and also the fall of your combination jump you beat Yuna, it doesn’t make sense, but the Host of those Olympics was not going to allow that…"
"I have never watched figure skating in my life, but Yuna was so much more graceful than Sotnikova. 

Especially the under rotated jump with a heavy landing"
"03:17  comedy,,,,"
She's just an athlete but Yuna Kim is an artist.

"everyone was saying she was better technically but is it really?

1:13 that 3 toe is underrotated
3:16 what?
4:00 lvl3 step sequence"
This video has 1/3 of views than Yuna Kim's sochi performance.
she just confessed that she had a positive a sample and normally wouldn’t be able to compete at 2014 what a shame
3:16 Gold???
This was her last Olympic and she never won any medal at international competition.  This fact tells us that she did not earn the gold medal by herself.
"‘Gold Medal Winning Performance’?????
What a joke?!

Y’all better title Yuna’s performance as ‘Diamond Medal Winning Performance!’"
"she must be ashamed of herself for the rest of her life... sorry sotty, you will be forgotten, but remembered only for your shameful medal..."
"It’s embarrassing…. Since then, figure skating is no longer a sport. until NOW."
"There are many great skaters in Russia, but she is not one of them. Yuna deserves the gold."
I'm still disgusted.
"She know ""She is not authentic gold medalist"""
"Great energy, lots of personality, two errors coming out of her jumps.  It just doesn’t compare to the elegance and flawlessness of Yuna.  I give the gold to Yuna."
"I remembered 
2006 Arakawa's ina bauer
2010 Yuna's beautiful 007 
2014 ???
2018 Zagitova's Don quijote 
2022 Shcherbakova's two quad flip

most worthless gold medal
"Still bitter after all these years, I believe I'm not the only one who feel unfair for Yuna. Yuna is muchhhhh better, is miles before  her."
Kim Yu-na is the real winner.
Everyone knows Yuna was robbed. Surprised they haven’t turned off the comments on this video 😂
3:17
"What I see from someone who's not knowledgeable in figure ice skating is that Sotnikova seems to follow a routine, and Yuna Kim is actually painting and telling a story. There's a huge artistic difference between the both"
"Literally just compare her step sequence to Mao’s during her free skate.

It is an embarrassment that Mao’s legendary Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto free skate was only third compared to this. Look at Yuna’s Adios Nonino and tell me that this is better. I’d laugh at you.

Sotnikova isn’t bad by any means, but she clearly didn’t deserve to be a gold medalist."
"When I recall Yuna and Adelina, I think of Princess Diana and Duchess Camilla. Adelina did get the gold, but Yuna will always be the ice queen of people’s hearts."
"Конечно она не такая изящная и маленькая как Юна, не такая пластичная, но программа составлена превосходно. Эта её некоторая ""деревянность"" вполне здесь уместна. 
Понравилось как она отыгрывает эмоции. Это был поистине счастливый прокат!
Я не техспециалист чтобы судить прыжки. Возможно пару раз она рановато вкрутилась в прыжок. 
Но в целом приятное впечатление от выступления. Жаль что ""драма с Юной"" оставила неприятный след на этой Олимпиаде. Ведь на самом деле вся тройка призеров замечательная! И Аделина, и Юна и, конечно же Каролина ❤❤❤"
"Смотрел  ПП Аделины в 2014 году и сейчас  смотрю и переживаю и любуюсь как она фантастически выполнила прокат и утерла нос распиаренной Липницкой , чиновникам от ФФКР с своими интригами и обошла фигуристку из Кореи . Браво Аделина"
"10년이 지났어도 짜증;
격이 존나 떨어지는 소치올림픽
기본적으로 
무슨 실수를 한사람한테 금메달을 주냐
예술성도 기품도 좃도없구만
박수호응유도 개웃😂 동네 마을회관 행사임?
자기네 나라 금메달 주는게 그게 뭔 스포츠고 세계대회냐 진짜 급떨어진다ㅋㅋ
동네 이장배 경기도 이러지않겠다"
Theres geniuses. Theres amazing skaters. Then theres this thing
I haven't watched an Olympics since.   Kim Yuna and Carolina Kostner were robbed.   I'm not even sure this skate is worthy of Bronze.   Technique wasn't proper in some jumps.   Yuna Kim was absolute textbook.
"I think the judges should also do
doping tests"
Are there comic extra points in figure skating?
"This is a magic show🎉
That's wonderful😂"
Her skating deserves no medal at all. This is def. not a gold.
Just want to let everyone know the dislike votes had reached over 1 million before dislikes were disabled on youtube.   Over 50 times the number of likes.
That Flutz alone would not garner her even a bronze and she won gold. What a joke. XD
This was such a fanastic skate. Bravo.
I'm here after watching Rino Matsuike and even her worst days are better than this
It would be embarrassing even to see Sotnikova herself. It is against the spirit of the Olympics. Even people who don't know figure skating can see her performance like that. Give it back to the gold medal owner. This is what people all over the world want.
Doping 😂
"It's such a shame. Yuna deserved to win. She deserved it 100%. But this wasn't bad at all. I liked her spins, her jumps, her spirals... She had so much potential. But then ISU did both her and the other competitors dirty by making her the gold medalist. Essentially destroyed her career. Neither Yuna or Carolina or Adelina deserved this."
💊💊💊💊💊💊💊
"Not an expert but this performance, as energetic and motivational it was, doesn't beat Kim Yuna's 'Imagine' to the eye, not even for someone like me who doesn't know a beat about skating. I guess this happens all the time in Sports..."
"Now Russia is destroying Ukraine, I have to come back here to re-watch how they destroyed Olympic sport. Yuna is the true gold medalist."
"러시아 사람들에게.
소치 올림픽 후 10년이 지났네요. 
러시아 피겨에 남은 건 뭔가요? 
심판을 매수하고 도핑을 해서 얻어낸 메달들이 정말로 자랑스럽나요?"
금메달 빼앗겨서 욕하는게 아니라 동메달보다 못하니깐 욕먹는거야. 약은 왜 먹었어? 실력도 없으면서 ㅎㅎ
러시안만 억빠하는거 씹길티네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
9 million people watch Yuna's adios nonino and only 3million watch this 😂😭😭😭😭 she is a robbery.obviously.
"스케이트 모르지만~
왜! 지금 봐도 옷기지? 
어떻게 이게 금메달인지 ㅋㅋㅋ 장난하는거 같네"
3:18 really?? Gold medal??
The comment section is full of Koreans breaking the defense.😂😂😂
3:18 이러고 금메달..?
The judges actually thought this performance was better than Queen Yuna's??? WTH
shame….. can’t believe this happened in OLYMPICS.
0:53 ?????
We all know who gave the gold medal performance that day.
Deduction: 0.00?????? With a doubke footed landing???
I don't think she is better than Yuna. She had a mistake.
"03:13 amazing '2-foot'landing I don't understand why the youtube is sugesting me this fluoresent moth's video,  plus 03:06 the russian judge who hugged with the moth after the show is like the moth's coach, getting the ryhdm
03:54 ""lovely"" ×, ""ugly"" o"
"They ended her career here. She would've been a fine bronze medalist (if they had to give it to her because of home inflation), but no they wanted another Russian to win the OGM too badly since Yulia fell. Well, she has all the benefits of an OGM in Russia but no one cares about Adelina. She is just a girl who skated well on home ice because she likely knew that she'd win because of politics. Based on her level, she was not ready to be an Olympic Champion. Carolina or Mao (had she gone clean in the SP) would've made fine Olympic Champions, but not Adelina. What the judges did at Sochi was a disgrace to the sport and to the athletes."
"I think Sotnikova is a really talented skater, having performed like this at only the age of 17. But Yuna was a lot more seasoned, and was just BETTER. Instead of this competition being the start of a great career, she will now be known, as the one who robbed the gold medal. This competition only brought her negative results. Shame on you, ISU."
When Yuna skated to 'Send in the Clowns' these were the Clowns that came in. ( You understand who the clowns are )
"Я всегда думала, почему фанаты ФК забыли про Сотникову. Сама узнала о ней лишь из передачи Дождя. Посмотрела и поняла. Скучный костюм, скучная программа. Не вызывает интереса вообще. Первое место не должно быть таким, первое место — это про то, чего не хочется забывать, первые места хочется пересматривать, как это было с Загитовой и Щербаковой, про Сотникову же хочется забыть.
Стыдно за такое судейство и такую несправедливую победу."
저렇게 실수많이 했는데 기쁨에 차서 울 정도면 평상시에는 얼마나 못한다는거냐
Yes I am still mad that Yuna was robbed!
이 연기가 금메달감이라고 말하는 사람=김연아의 연기를 아직 못 본 사람
"сколько ни смотрю, для меня Юна Ким откатала эффектнее и красивее, не могу разглядеть в Аделине чего-то такого, разве что её очень интересные вращения.."
Опять некрасивое платье как и в короткой. Хореографии и задумки нет. Беспорядочно руками машет. И эти ее призывы к зрителям с просьбами аплодисментов так смешно выглядят.
"a veces me quiero olvidar de esto pero luego me acuerdo que a su secuencia de pasos le dieron nivel 4 más GOE que a la de Mao y Yuna(solo nivel 3),y me vuelvo a amargar."
doping and cheating
why did she skate the whole programe with her mouth open?
I feel sad for her. Her career got lost because of other’s people’s ambition
❤❤ loving her performance
Adelina Sotnikova won her real gold medal when YouTube removed dislikes
Most shameful episode in skating history!
"Again, if you think this is close to that 150.08 by Yuna in Vancouver 2010, then we might be in twilight zone, still."
Are casters serious? Was it fantastic performance?? Are they paid from Russia?
doping!!!!!doping!!!doping!!!!!!doping!!!!!!Sotnikova~!!!!
"Не очень она катается, лично я очень надеялась что выиграет Липницкая. Ну или Юна Ким ( она очень талантливая и заслуживает победу) но Сотникова кажется или должна была остаться с бронзой, а может  без медали. 
Жаль Туктамышевой не было, она бы точно медаль взяла"
점프하고 나서 착지 자세만 봐도 김연아랑 엄청 차이나는데 진짜 보면볼수록 저게 어떻게 금메달리스트의 피겨인지 모르겠다...정말
장갑부터 마이너스 10점
점프 실수가 완연하고 클린 연기도 아니건만 금메달이라 정말 이해할 수 없는 어이가 없는 판정.
🥇🥇🥇I sleep well at night knowing she won the gold medal🥇🥇🥇😂❤️
진짜 동작 하나하나가 요란하다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"Честно говоря, я рада что Юля тогда упала и не попала на пьедестал даже. По крайней мере никто не подозревает ее в допинге и не оспаривает ее результаты"
if the eurosport commentator of all people doesn’t agree with the scores then you have royally fucked up
She is NOT an Olympic champion!!
🚨WANTED:GOLD MEDAL THIEF🚨
It's kind of funny to me comments aren't disabled for this video. Is there a single person who agrees she deserved that medal?
Circus
She's smiling through the whole thing she knows she's getting Gold:/  Probably told her she will get it!! Robbery!!  Yuna should of gotten Gold!!!!  Like the anchor said not magical Yuna's performance was Magical!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shame on all the judges!
Still furious
"더러운 의상과 스케이팅스킬
플러츠를 뛰고 투풋 랜딩 해놓고 금메달을 강탈했네"
"So boring to watch, skip. 😊"
"4:22  경기중에 응원유도 
4:29  누군가에게 손을 흔듬 이게 연기인가"
"I haven`t looked a this in many years, I was pissed with the outcome.  I`m sorry it doesn`t improve with age.  There is no content here.  Stroke, stroke, jump.  This is a 1st year senior program.  Appaling."
Disgusting
"Since youtube removed the dislikes, here are the current like/dislike ratio: 23K likes, 58K dislikes. Enough said..."
"That poor girl... if ever there was an olympic gold medal that cursed its holder, it was this one. She's very young here and with time she could have become great because she's obviously not bad, but she'll forever now be known as the skater who won the gold medal because the game was rigged in her favor."
진심  올림픽을 러시아에서 개최 하지 않고 리프니츠카야가 실수하지 않았다면   넌 금메달이고 이름이고 둘 다  알려졌겠나 무명으로 존재가 묻어졌겠지 너는  욕 먹는것도 감사해야 된다 분수에 맞게 살아야지 메달 프라자에서 금이 동으로 변하고 은이 금으로 빛 났던건 메달들도 주인을 알아본거지  보통 선수들도 점프 제외하고 스핀에서 잘하는게 한가지는 있는데 넌 스핀이고 스텝이고 점프고 모든게 별로구나 그런 너가 피겨 꿈나무 가르친다고 코치 선생인게 웃긴다 ㅋㅋ
even russians forgat their first olympic champion 😅 I think it ruins the countries image just give the gold to yuna
Yuna was better
I didn't care who won the gold medal. In my mind all these young girls are champions.
"She looks so stiff. 
No connection and elegant btw motions."
"Nice tecnic, beautiful performance. But Yuna is an artist. She transmits so much, you can compare that."
3:17
마오의 신들린 long program 보다도 점수가 높았네
7:02 더블룹은 심지어 두발로 뛰고 두발로 착지하네 ㅋㅋㅋ
1:40 2:54 3:12
뚝딱거리는 저 팔을 자를순없고
"Amazing height of jumps, speed and agility, surprising spins, musical expression, healthy and attractive looks
Demonstrating her talent, she was absolutely the most brilliant skater on this Olympic day.
I want to say again and again, congratulations Adelina-chan!"
"3Fe+3T< : Nice Flutz, Nice Underrotation 😊 with a Positive GOE 😊 

3F+2T+2LO : What amazing Prerotation and full blade assistance on the Flip... Two footed, should have higher deduction...

THAT PCS ???? With the mistakes ???"
"8년이나 지났는데 3:19 만 보면 화남
어거지점프"
"Шикарно! 👏 
И после такой Олимпийской чемпионки, следующую хотели сделать Медведеву? Смешно)"
"I love Yuna Kim so much, she is outstanding, she does art on ice, but just look at Adelina’s spins, look at how she rotates, this is an art too, just a little different. 
You may not agree, but to me Adelina is and forever will be a champion in Sochi 2014"
Greatest theft in Olympic history!
It's 2022 already but I'm not over with this!!!!!!!! Please pull yourself together Russians!! Wake up and listen to the world!!
Выиграла по делу: сделала 3-х прыжков 7 штук. Ким сделала 6 тройных и второй лутц сильно не докрутила.
legendary fake skating
"댓글도 거의가 김연아가 우승이라고… 참, 소트니도 무안하긴 하겠다. 그냥 연아가 금메달, 소트니가 은메달 였으면 깨끗하고 멋진 메달리스트가 됐을텐데… 안타깝네"
"I just will never get over the pain from seeing Yuna being so blindly robbed, the whole world agreeing even non skating fans and no one being able to do anything about it. This skate was a joke."
I hope she lives in peace now.  She got so much hate despise being only 17. I actually love her skate.
Yuna should be the winner
Anyone remember how many dislikes this video had before YouTube removed them? I know it was quite a high number but just can’t remember how many😅
No wonder Russia is at war with the entire world... like literally 😂😂😂😂
7:01 착지 실수 뻔히 보이는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
나도 다시 봐도 열 뻗히는데 본인은 오죽할까.. 그래도 전 세계가 인정 안 하는 1위 전 세계가 인정하는 2위.
No one recognizes you as a queen!!
"Ненавистники Русского Духа штампуют глупые восторги по поводу прекрасной Юны...никто не спорит, что она великолепна, но: есть красивое --- и Прекрасное, то есть Аделина.  Есть река--- и есть море, это Аделина! Есть будни, Юна--- и есть Праздник человеческого бытия, то есть Аделина!! Есть меланхоличная дивная песня, Юна--- и есть изумительный, жизнеутверждающий  Моцарт Аделины !!"
Иронично что это одна из самых непопулярных программ олимпийской чемпионки )
Doping
Fakest gold of all time. Yuna was so much better
"Какое исполнение программы!!! Как выстрелила, скорость, четкость. Российская школа фигурного катания ❤. Спасибо за талант Ангелине ❤."
4:22 관객호응은 그렇다쳐도... 4:28 도대체 누구한테 손흔든걸까
"The problem isn't her performance, after all she did everything she could. The problem is the judges and her scores, and the way she acted after winning the medal."
"Sotnikova,Shame on you!"
why are you hating her? THE JUDGES PREFERED HER!
아무리 생각해도 소트니코바는 본인 스스로에게 창피함을 알아야 함
DOPING....DOPING....CHEATERS.....DOPING CHEATERS.
"Позор Сочи, украдена золотая медаль, которую явно заслужила великая Юна Ким"
Unfair . The judges did't think  about the future.
I think there was a mistake in the title it should be called Adelina’s bronze medal program not gold
yuna deserved the gold 100%
"""not syue i agree with that""
from an official olympic commentator is... telling"
i just don't understand why they would take a skater and turn her into a villain for the purpose of securing gold.
step 4 ?
"I watched this performance back then.  I thought it was a pretty rough one... Disney on Ice has more talented skaters.  It was held in Sochi so, it was very predictable that Yuna Kim was going to be robbed of the gold."
"she looks a bit boring tbh, and her footworks, movement and landed aren't that smooth, some weren't perfect and you can see it with bare eyes."
이게 올림픽 프로그램이라는 게 믿기지 않는다... 피겨 선수가 음악이 흐르는 빙판에 집중하지 않고 호응이나 유도하면서 마치 본인 콘서트인 양 팬서비스 하는 가벼운  프로그램이 금메달이라니... 거기에 박수치고 있는 러시아 관객들은 뭐지? 이미 자국 선수의 금메달을 예상하고 있었던 것처럼? 아예 니들끼리 피겨듀스 101 찍지 왜 ㅋㅋㅋ 나만 금메달 없어 ㅜㅜ 우는 애도 불쌍하면 걍 투표로 1등 주면 되잖아? 아... 약발 떨어진 애들은 취급 안 해서 101명이 안되지 참
You got the gold medal but the world forever remembers you as a robber. Is the reputation worth it?
Her doping sample has scratch on it
"Gold medal 3.4m views
Kim yuna 9.4m views look at that 
Who are people more interested in???? We are not blind that is a big mistake ...f judges"
"Medal thief, disgraceful and unsportsmanlike"
"Aquí vine q poner mi comentario que esta persona le robó El Oro a mi reina Yuna Kim.
Hasta la música es aburrida la primer parte. Pinche weba esta vieja!!!!!!!! 
Gracias Rusia por robarle El Oro a Korea. 
Nunca se olvidará. Vendré en años sucesivos a recordárselos!!!!
Hoy es 2024, hace 10 años le robaron a mi queen, Kim Yuna."
3:17 7:00 연아 보유국으로서 뚝딱이는 못 참지
9년만에 봐도… 사적인 감정과 빡침을 다 내려놓고 그냥 누가봐도 김연아가 우승인데… 물론 파워풀하긴 했지만.. 그럼 뭐해 클린도 아니고 실수 투성이에 점수 몰아주기로 우승인데… 진짜 러시아랑 중국 심판들은… 말로 표현을 못할 만큼 못됨
Excellent skating performance by Adelina Sotnikova.  You  deserved the Gold Medal.
"Нормально, но это не золото и даже не серебро"
"Аделина выдала два проката жизни, поэтому она победила!!! Очень нравится её произвольная программа, очень интересная и эмоциональная!"
보는 내내 뻣뻣하고 안무도 제대로 소화 못하는 저 선수한테 금메달이 왠 말이냐ㅡㅡ 다시 봐도 화나려고 하네 두 발 다 닿았는데도 점수가 높은 게 말이 안 된다 저게 어떻게 금메달리스트 점프냐 10년 후인 지금 봐도 너무 치떨린다
Your 2014 bronze medalist!
다시봐도 존나삐걱거리는데 저게금메달인게 말이안된다
다시 봐도 화난다.
"Do I think she deserved to win gold over Yuna? No but I do prefer her skating over other Russian ladies skaters, who have small jumps and no artistry."
She's not qualified for a gold medal. Shame on you.
It’s almost 2023 and Koreans are still salty 😂
No integrity to this award whatsoever.
"For those curious, there are 55K dislikes on this vid."
"The unkind and unsportsmanlike comments say a lot about the nasty trolls who follow this sport and give it a bad reputation. In many ways it reminds me of the bitchy comments when Tara Lipinski beat Michelle Kwan. this is a sport , and this skater out skated the others on the elements. You may prefer one skater over another, but do try and be graceful and respectful"
Shame on Russia!  Be better.  Stop doping.  Stop invading.
Beautiful Champion's 🏅
*KIM YUNA*
"애초에 기본 스케이팅 스킬 자체가 연아랑 카롤리나보다 많이 떨어짐 ㅇㅇ 굉장히 거침. 예전 이리나슬루츠카야 하위버젼;;; 솔까말 기본 스킬은 골드보다도 떨어짐... 기술점에서 러츠롱엣지랑 후속토 회전 봐준건 걍 홈 프리미엄으로 인정해준다 하더라도, 구성점이 67을 넘는건 ㄹㅇ 말도안됨. 기본 스케이팅은 부드러운 아사다마오도 구성점 69였음..."
도핑 테스트 문제의 선수. 그래도 그녀의 금메달이 공평하다 생각해? 이건 올림픽이야! 정신차려라
She is comedian
Demmm is she not ashamed??? Has she said anything??
"전 세계적으로 
알아주시니 은메달이 값지네요
감사합니다"
"I'm sure Sotnikova did her best, and I applaud her performance.  However,  I still  believe Yuna's performance was better.  I'm surpriced learn that she (the Olympic gold medalist) placed  ""4th in the individual competition of Japan Open, and  placed 6th at the 2015 Golden Spin of Zagreb"" (not even a year after of the Olympic)...."
even yulia is better than her😭
The olympics is hugely embarrassing for this. Daylight robbery
도핑하고 두발로 착지하기
Yeah one of those olympic moments that was so rigged even stevie wonder could see what was going on.
Looks very shoddy. You do not deserve a gold medal. You are NOT supposed to be there. Explain why your dopping sample was destroyed.
La medallista del fraude...que verguenza para Adelina.
피겨 올림픽 비극의 시작. 베이징 올림픽 아주 난장판임ㅎ
A clown that nobody remembers
Sham gold medal
"Yuna Kim was better. The same is true about Slutskaya in 2002, Plushenko in 2010, Nemov in 2004 etc. That had to happen one day for the balance."
Alina Zagitova is real first Russian woman to win a gold.
3:14 mistake?
this is gotta be the most boring free skate ever
No deductions at all? 😂
AFTER 10 YEARS ITS STILL HURTS YUNA KIM SHOULD WON GOLD IT WAS ROBBERY
"I understand people don't like Sotnikova because she won the gold medal, but her program was difficult with the combinations and difficult spins. But her PCS, step sequence and jump goes were inflated and scored higher than they should have. For example she got a step sequence level 4 here even though she always does a level 3 and like the commenter said her PCS score was higher than Kostner and it shouldn't have been. Either way this was the judges fault for inflating her scores and not judging correctly so that she could win because they wanted a Russian winner."
BEAUTIFUL JUMP! GRATZ FOR THE GOLD MEDAL 🙂🤜💩
"Специально посмотрела начало обеих девочек и Юны и Аделины. Первые два прыжка у них ИДЕНТИЧНЫЕ, третий же у Аделины, уже сложнее. И почему люди говорят, что Аделина выиграла не честно?! Диванные критики?"
"Прекрасное выступление, Аделина была первой русской, победившей на ОИ, но далеко не последней..)))"
"Sotnikova男性化 的女人、
動作不優雅、不柔美,
給149分,太誇張🙈,
她很多滑冰基本動作沒做到.. 
特異獨行 動作倒不少."
다시 보니 어려서 힘은 있는데 그게 다야. 그냥 연아가 얼마나 더 위대한 스케이터였는지 증명하는 비교영상이지 뭥...ㅎㅎㅎ
7:43 타라소바는 저렇게 솥 아껴주는 척 하면서 나중에 솥 올챔 자격 없다고 깐게 코미디 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"Not to hate on political agendas: her short program is actually not bad, but this free program is just terrible...I don't get the music and her movement seems so out of places. Massive prerotation on the jumps. Might be worthy of a bronze medal but definitely not a gold."
Gold medal thief....people in the world will remember it forever
스트레스 받고싶어서 2022년에 왔음 오매 이거보니 열불나 ♨️♨️ 금메달 도둑님 보니깐 스트레스 수치 20000000% 아직까지도 열불나네 언제 돌려줄꺼냐 주인찾아줘 ~ 다시 연아님 영상보고 마음의 안정을 찾아야겠어욤😊
Terrible
대대손손 수치스럽겠다. 솔직히 엄마가 소트니코바라고 하기 쪽팔릴듯ㅋㅋㅋ
참 단조로운 안무인데 그마저도 예쁘게 소화를 못하네
Where is she? I couldnt see her after this olympic. she shouldve dominated for some years if she was judged properly in this olympic
So what did she achieve after that?
"これはどう見てもヨナの方が勝ちだよ
贔屓とはこういうことか"
Fake
Nobody regards this Russian as Gold Medalist
4:34 What the
"Russia took away Yuna's gold medal, and now it's tryna take away Ukraine's land lmfao"
"Yoon's legend, Adelinа misunderstanding"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ걍 웃음밖에 안나온다
What a train wreck this is. Can someone explain how she scored higher than Yuna?
She stole the medal. She is NOT THE CHAMPION
Gold Medal should belong to Kim Yuna !!! 🏵
다시 보니 소트니코바도 잘했음 힘이 장난아님 굉장히 파워풀~ 그러나 연아처렁 나비가 부드럽게 흘러가듯 날아오르는 아름다움 그 섬세한 예술성은 매우 아쉬움 그저 힘쓰는 피겨 스포츠 같다. 연아와는 비교할수 없음
"2022, I'm from Russia and I'm still thinking this is an unfair win"
Платья и программы ужас конечно 🙈 в олимпийский сезон могли бы и постараться)
4:22 호응유도하는 거 진짜 격떨어져보인다
"Vale que Yuna fue mejor, pero sinceramente comparada con las campeonas rusas actuales creo que le da cien vueltas. Tiene coreografía, bonitos spins, saltos largos. Las rusas de ahora aunque hagan fake quads, apenas se desplazan, sus saltos no tienen altura, su técnica deja mucho que desear"
She should know how much shameful gold medal she got with  unfair advantage.
"142-144 at best. Technical points 3-4 inflated, component score 2-3 inflated.

Specifically, the wrong edge uncalled for on 3L-3T, the deduction on 3F-2T-2L was only -0.9 which was supposed to be -1.5 at least, and THAT STSQ got Level4 with 1.7 GEO which to me is just insanely inflated. It was def level3 and 0.5 GEO at best. Also there's no way this presents higher composition and interpretation than Yuna Kim which is the case. This is a clear case that Olympics game sold out by Russians."
"야 !! 형광나방 반가워 !! 나 우울할때면 너의 나방 허우적 연기 보러와! 고마워 
요즘 너의 후배들이 약물하더라 그런데도 예술성은 떨어지는 로보트야:( 난 너의 나방연기가 좋아! ㅋㅋ 영원히 남아죠"
I’m sorry but she is so much better than the recent two Olympic champions
세상에서 가장 초라한 금메달 도둑
BOZO! yuna should've won
"음..... 기계처럼 뻣뻣하다... 억지로 파워풀하게 춤추는모습... 🥲 
(연아킴의 그냥 물흐르듯 물아일체..완벽한 예술적  피겨인거에 반해서...  쯥.....)"
"Снова наслаждаюсь программой Петра Чернышова и Аделиной. Самая прекраснаЯ женская ПП во всё 20 и 21 век. Она ещё одно подтверждение, что мы созданы по образу и подобию Божию. Браво, человек"
소트니코바의 금은 러시아 피겨를 360도 비꿔 놓았다. 그것은 베이징 올림픽에서도 유효하다.
"김연아랑 비교하기 민망할 정도로 연기의 예술성이 하늘과 땅 수준보다 더 차이 난다 ㅋㅋㅋ 김연아 연기는 예뻐서 진심으로 감탄하다가 왔는데, 비교군이 김연아라서 더 그래보일수도 있지만 소트니코바 연기는 걍 안예뻐... 뚝딱거리는 고장난 로봇같음. 빙판 쓰는 면적도 너무 좁고 엣지나 착지도 별론데 약 빨아먹고 점프만 높이 뛰면 다인가 피겨 말고 빙판에서 높이뛰기 경기였나봐요"
3:17 .... ??? Gold medal???🤣
The only thing I like about Adelina is her spins.
정말 다시봐도 더럽고 역겨워
"The only thing aceptable about Adelina are her spins. I kinda like them. However her jumps are something different… sorry but no, I skip."
"율리아 정도 실력이었다면
이정도 이슈는 안 되었을텐데
상체가 너무 뻣뻣하고 아마추어 느낌이 심하네요"
Как жаль что Дине Авериной это золото откатилось серебром
"Tambien existe el oro farsante, deshonesto, tramposo. Aquí la prueba 🤡"
Yuna did much better than sotnikova
이제는 괜찮을줄 알았는데 아직도 개빡치네
Simply beautiful❤❤❤
Just…awful
"점프후 착지 실수에 발발거리고 뛰어다니듯 타는 스케이트를 금메달 받을 자격이 있다고?
연아랑 둘의 경기를 봐라..한눈에도 실력차가 보인다.."

She deserved the win much faster and more interesting than Kim’s program"
"Хоть сам являюсь русским и видел эти прокаты в 2014 году, как и вся Россия и могу сказать, что Россия тоже тогда была недовольна ее прокатом. Все удивились, когда она выиграла"

"If you have any decency, return and give that gold medal to the real owner."
"Иногда смотришь олимпийские игры и понимаешь. что в фигурке справедливость не существует. Столько раз впереди настоящей звезды оказывается выскочка-однодневка с золотой ложкой во рту.  Я из России, но я за Юну!"
"This is so far the most unmemorable ""gold medal"" performance in women's figure skating -- worldwide speaking. Sure, it's memorable to the Russians but that's not really saying anything."
wrong edge
doping medal
"저런 로보트 춤과 , 두발 착지로 금메달리스트??  창피한줄 알아라."
얘는 8년이 지나도 가루가 되게 까이네..
yall need to move onnnnn 😭
썸네일부터가 개웃기네
Keep smiling and savor the victory cause that will be your last gold medal unless the judges cheat again. I'm not from korea but i love kim yuna performance better.
Incredible performance. Never saw that before. She is the most talented beautiful figure skater.
"스텝시퀀스는 기괴하고 우악스럽기까지하다, 과했어

The Worst Olympic Medalist Ever.
Shame on you ISU!!!
mid af. give the medal to yuna
Most shameful performance !

Look at that tree.. 😱
자격이 없다는 것을 스스로가 알 것임 창피한 금메달이다…..
심사위원의 양심을 팔아서 억지로 가져간 금메달. 양심을 팔았기에 진심으로 동의할 수 없는 메달
Gold medal thief. Her country is the main culprit
마임하냐 초반에 줄다리기하네 혼자
"women's skatings peak and spark was lost at this competition, yuna kim was robbed, although adelina was an amazing skater its obvious she did not do a gold medal skate, rigged xx"
wow 🥰😍
ロシア人って名前みんな似てるwwそして可愛い人が多い。ロシアに行きたい🇷🇺🪆
She's not bad...but she's definitely no Yulia.
"Actually, a bronze medal is too much for her."
은이 금보다 밝게 빛났던 날...
"일단 음악부터 마음에 안든다

Gold medal thief
"I deliberately found the 2014 programmes to watch and don't understand why some people are down on Sotnikova. She had exciting and energetic programmes for both SP & FS, and had great WOW factors in her performance. Figure Skating should be exciting, beautiful and athletic. She won fair and square."
@Olympics why would you actually put this up LOL now we can cross reference her previous similar performances to see how the judges hyperinflated the scores 😂
"Сравнение с юной, всегда так будет наверняка, каждому по мебали не получится😊"
"Только к Аделине претензии? Что то не вижу гневных комментариев россиян, когда их откровенно засудили  на олимпиадах. Перечислять даже не хочу. Все заказное было"
아 아직도 화난다
I dont know whats happening but im sleeping now
"Заявленный Сотниковой каскад имеет большую базовую стоимость по сравнению с каскадом Ким, потому что она выбрала самый сложный из двойных прыжков – аксель. Высокую оценку за исполнение (GOE – grade of execution) ей поставили за плавность, высоту прыжков и дистанцию. Также она получила бонус в 10% за исполнение каскада во второй половине программы."
"Oh, Adelina. She was absolutely unreal in this program. Divine."
관객호응 유도 리얼 콘서트 인줄ㄱㄱㄲㄱㄲㅋㄱㅋ  평생 가짜금메달 집착하며 살길
should’ve been yuna’s
"В чем замысел этой программы? Кого она тут изображает? Кто-нибудь может мне объяснить? Мне просто непонятно, хотелось бы знать"
Sotnikova's arms were also skating.
And shoutout to Karolina coz she bodied as well tbh
Аделия Сотникова - очень тебя любим!!!
"Yuna Kim a verdadeira campeã,  uma vergonha Satnikova's ter levado, com essa paginação engessada e sem elegância, saltos sujos e não tecnicamente  corretos, até  num deles aterrizou com os dois pés. Lamentável."
За месяц до этого она за последние вращение получила второй уровень
금메달도 무슨 메달리스트에 들어가는 것도 아깝다...
0:49 처음 들어가는 연기 안무부터 왜 저럼? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 손 모아서 휘리릭 하는 거 개웃기다 진짜. 호두까끼 인형 컨셉임? ㅋㅋㅋ 겁나 뚜둑 거리는 느낌.
Oh Adelina  ! ❤️
"Hey, Sotnikova! What a shameful performance!!! This cannot be a gold medal in Olympic games. Don't you agree?"
"Да, это Золото!!!!"
저딴기 금메달 ㅋㅋ 제일 기억에도 안남는 금메달리스트는 처음이다 하긴 실력이라도 있어야 기억이 날텐데 실력도 형편없는데다가 억지로 받은거니까 기억속에도 없지
What  physical grace to go along with it all!
"8년이 지난후 소치때 분노버리고
평정심을 찾고 다시봄
김연아랑 비교가 안되는게
처음부터 유연성은 전혀없고
점프 높이가 낮음. 몸이 무거워보임
두발착지 한것 빼고도
다른점프시 착지과정에서 불안정함."
Do all skaters spin clockwise rather than counterclockwise?
"Her skating skills are absolutely superb, and the choreogrpahy is amazingly beautiful and fun to watch."
this choreography is otherworldly boring
Sotnikova did not deserve gold!
"25.10.2022, тянет к этой программе, и всё тут! Время не властно над этой Изумительной программой и исполнением!! Восьмое чудо света! По красоте, стильности, изысканности с а м а я необыкновенная программа на земле!! Говорю после прекрасной ПП Анюты на Олимпиаде! Штаб эту программу по  ослепительному   блеску не перекрыл и остался на прекрасном 2 месте...Аделина чудо, спасибо тебе и твоей команде!   Но Анюта так и осталась любимицей осталась"
확실히 비리가 있다
She deserved he Gold!
gold?
Lmao the dislike bar says it all. Yuna Kim > Sotniwho?
"I don’t know. In reviewing both performances again 10 years later, it appears to me that they were fairly equal - both programs were fantastic. Honestly, it’s a coin toss. In retrospect, the controversy now seems without much merit. At the time, I thought Yuna Kim was robbed. I no longer feel that way. Adelina deserved the gold medal. Although, if Yuna Kim had won the gold medal it would have been likewise deserved."
She had the skate of her life that night. It was unexpected but she had solid jumps and solid spins. Stay mad haters. (Not to mention yuna downgraded herself and did one less triple than her gold winning performance in 2010. If she was the best in the world she would show us that she can do 7 triples and not 6. It’s not 1993… you need at least 7 triples)
The worst figure skater
기술점수 자체는 김연아보다 왜 높은지 알겠음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 물론 러츠가 플립이랑 구분이 안될정도로 구리고 프리로테도 있지만 그정도야 심판들 지금도 흐린눈하는 새기들 ㅈㄴ 많음 근데 저 뚝딱대는 스케이팅은 진짜 봐도봐도 적응이 안되네... 뚝딱이 그자체인데 저 PCS에 김연아 벤쿠버 인생연기 기록에 고작 0.11점 차이라는게ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ ㄹㅇ 코미디
She has to live with this (everybody judging her win as unfair and big bad taste joke).
올림픽 품격 잘 느꼈습니다.
"Аделина Сотникова самая талантливая фигуристка: какие линии, какая растяжка, мощь прыжка, уникальные нетривиальные позиции во вращениях, кураж и харизма в нужный момент, воспоминания как будто вчера откатала."
How come its on YouTube for everyone to see yet she wasn’t forced to give the medal back to the true winner???!
The most ridiculous “gold medal performance” in the history of figure skating.
Grande 🙏
блатная чемпионка
she is a beautiful woman but lacks artistry
"Сколько желчи в комментариях... Успокойтесь, соревнуйтесь теперь без России, выигрывайте свое золото, которое теперь уже никогда не будет настоящим. Потому что нельзя считать себя сильнейшим, просто вычеркнув сильного соперника из соревнований:) везде у вас, где вы проиграли, русские надавили, наелись допинга... Ну вот теперь, я надеюсь, вы вполне счастливы. Мы, думаю, вполне. Все абсолютно в стране устали от формата Олимпийских игр, политизированных донельзя, изживших себя. Кстати, интересно, русские балерины тоже на таблетках, наверное, сидят, иначе чем же объяснить их мастерство?... Короче, купите себе этих волшебных таблеток, если они есть, и станьте лучше и счастливее:) надеюсь, поможет:)"
Is that gold?
3:18 what the….lol hahahahahahahaha what a shame
Best hollywood action ^0^
This is the reason the communist state should never host any major sports events anymore... ^^
"I wonder how would she live life with that disgrace knowing that she cheatedly won gold that she didn't deserve.
Shame on the judges😔"
"She’s great. I don’t understand all the hate towards her.
1) She was cleared for doping. Go check that before accusing her.
2) She had way more techniques and crazier ones than Yuna

Both were great, but she really did deserve the win"
Sotnikova😍😍😍😍😍
In my opinion she was rather stiff like her music
when figure skating was beautiful feminine and such a delicht to watch....not a machine girls jumping from one corner to the other
Fake
Its a shame you posted this.
"If she and Russia just aimed at silver or bronze, it could seem better or somehow reasonable. But taking an olympic gold away from yuna was ridiculous. Too much greed."
"You GO, girl! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Russia has destroyed the spirit of sports.
💊💊💊💊
저따위 퍼포먼스가 뱀키 레미제라블보다 높고 죽무 007 거쉰이랑 비슷한점수인게 말이되나 져지들은 눈이없는건가
"I dare not say that the gold is undeserved. Yuna is also great, but Adeline's strength has taken over, admit it, don't beat her heart with a hammer. She has invested a lot in these programs and gold."
Still i'm mad
3Lze-3T<<
Adelina Socheatkova
Years later and she is still a cheater!!! How does it feel to live knowing you stole Yuna Kim's gold medal and you don't deserve it!
HUGE PREROTATION😂
"Why to blame this young girl for something that wasn’t under her control? She indeed did her best and deserved to be happy that day. I think silver would’ve served her better honestly, but it is was it is, if it wasn’t lipnitskaya failing Russia would’ve gotten the home gold they wanted. Adelina wasn’t anyone’s expected gold as she even wasn’t included in  teams event. The girl had great purpose in her skating, she dedicated it to her sister with disabilities. Stop the hate people."
불쌍한 우리 김연아 선수.... 소중한 금메달을 약쟁이한테 뺏겨버렸어 지금이라도 금메달 뱉어내ㅜㅜ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ다들 이거 생각나서 찾아왔네
O viață frumoasă și sănătoasă oriunde
"she’s current sochi gold medalist.
so when will the final result come out?"
Disgusting judge !
gold medal??? oh no!!😭😅😳
Вот так без всяких выкрутасов спокойно берут золото..❤ Супер!
김연아 Kim Yuna🥇
It is still a very rough performance even though 10 years has passed. How slow between spins!
Can anyone agree?
Love the racism from the Koreans in the comments!
What a joke
Russia is 💊
Robbery.
A masterpiece
"She is still the worst skater in figure skating world and will be forever.
She confessed that she had a problem in dopping test."
First and Last gold. PERIOD.
"Господи, да когда ж такое было то, что притягивали оценки в пользу русских. Смешно. Русских всю жизнь только засуживают и медали отнимают. 
Так что Аделина - ты лучшая, мы тебя любим."
ㅋㅋ 진짜 약빤거 같오. 동작이 빠르고 강하긴 한데 자연스럽게 연결되지가 않고 우아함도 없고 걍  로버트 같음
Fake life
"금메달 도둑의심,,, 
심판매수의심,,, 
약물의심,,,
최악갈라쇼,,,
금훔친뒤 단한번도 입상한적없음,,,"
She pretty much keeps the same speed throughout the whole 8 minutes! Amazing!
이것이 판사들의 공모라고 생각하는 한국인들. 로이 존스와의 그 이야기를 기억하고 사과하세요
Yuna kim 🥰
다시봐도 이해가 안되네 금메달감은 아니잖아?
천박함의 최고치
예술적인 건 김연아가 훨씬 아름다웠다. 손과 발의 선이나 느낌은 김연아를 따라 가지 못했다.
ㅋㅋ...클린도못해놓고 김연아보다 더 감동적으로 우네..뭐하냐?? 지금봐도 어이가없다
"그렇게 완벽한 연기가 아니었는데
마치 금인걸 알고 있었던것처럼
미리 기대하며 결과를 기다리는건
이미 내정되어 있는걸 알았나보네요."
다시와서보니 점프뛸때 조급해보임
This channel uploaded Yuna’s gala program 2 years a go yet still no upload of Sotnikova’s gold winning gala lol
Lol i can't believe this is an olympic level gold medal 😂👎
"그녀는 자백했다.
도핑했다고"
형광나방 파리  갈라쇼 어디서 보나요?
its been a decade. she skated fine but yuna was mesmerising. even yulia‘s technique was better.
"10년만에 다시 봄..
솔직히 잘하긴 했다.확실히 힘이 넘치고 제자리 팽이처럼 도는건 상당히 난이도가 있어보임.
홈콜은 당연한거고 관중 호응까지 유도하는것도 훌륭하다.
위대한 연기였다고 본다.

하지만 금은 김연아다.
파워 빼고는 김연아가 모두 앞섰다고 본다.김연아의 무대는 감동이 있다."
she skated beautifully i think she absolutely deserved that gold medal she was on fire the whole time she made some mistakes but she still landed all her jumps with great height !!
무슨 안무가 이따고여
Bravoooooo
"I don't know, I watch this video at least once a month and I'm always in tears"
3:18 저러고도 금메달을 받고싶더냐.7:03도둑심뽀.인간이라면 평생 부끄러워할일이지만 나방따위니 양심도 없겠지.역사에는 영원히 남아 니가 죽어도 남아있다.ㅉㅉㅉ 불쌍한나라.거지가 차라리 났지.자존심도없나
"Она не грабительница,грабительница с большой буквы Сара Хьюз,у нашей Ирины Слуцкой,в Сойтлак сити,у Адели сложнее программа чем у Ким,прыжки высокие,у Юны  есть минусы,прыжки сложнее у сотниковой чем у Ким,вращения"
"this comment section is disgusting. go bark away at the judges, but stop coming for Sotnikova. She did her best, and she got the gold, and for you guys to constantly try to take that away from her is disgusting. it's not like she made the scores or the results, she just skated her heart out, just like any other skater, and happened to win. i think her performance is fine, and to try and take away her accomplishments from her, to try and degrade her for simply putting years and years of work into this 4 minute routine is so disgusting. if you think yuna is a greater skater that's fine. but you don't have to say that she's ""shrek on ice"" or a ""mediocre skater"" because that's so insulting and beyond exaggerating. it should be a proud moment for her to win gold, but instead, you guys shame her for it. that's disgusting."
"This is even worse than I remember lmfao Russia was so wrong to prop this girl up. Like, at least give her a decent program if you’re going to pretend that this is the best skater in the world."
지금보니까 약에 취한거같아보인다 정신없고 안넘어지게 기술 하는데 다급해보여 연아는 우아하고 감정이 담겨있는데
확실히 못하진 않았는데 김연아 선수보단 훨 못함 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 러시아 피겨? 피겨라고 하기도 아까움 그냥. 점수도 부정한 점수; 그렇게 금 따놓고 지네들 선수 대단하다고 옹호하는 러시아 놈들은 그냥 상종을 안 하는 게 답인 듯... 팩트는 전 세계가 김연아를 외친다고 말을 해도 못 알아쳐먹음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
김연아가 주문한 광대가 여기있다고해서 찾아왔습니다
9년만에 봐도 놀랍다 도핑을 해도 김연아 보다 훨씬 못했음에도 금메달을 땄다는게 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Yuna 🏆
"so many comments, and not a single one that would praise Adeline’s program... she also skated very beautifully, gracefully, artistically, but why does everyone simply devalue her months of preparation and hard training? she, like all figure skaters, took a long time to achieve this. yes, Yuna's program deserves better, but why are you just devaluing Adeline? I feel very bad for this girl, how much work has been put into this rental, and she has only been subjected to a barrage of criticism and hate for so many years, it’s terrible. Adeline is a great girl and also skated beautifully! gorgeous!"

Ew.
Adelina's performance is mesmerizing. Sport and artistry in one. Her jumps are perfect and simply beautiful. She is so much above her competition.
아니..ㅋㅋㄱ아무리봐도 안무가 기괴햌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ똥망한 점프를 빼고봐도..저 주옥같은 곡은 연아가했으면 어땠은까싶은 생각까지드네... 저게 러시아 감성인가? 글구 저렇게 스스로가 뿌듯할만큼 클린경기였나?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

뭐가 예술성이 높고 뭐가 기술이 어려웠다는 말인가? 심지어 트리플에서 실수도 했다. 금메달 자격 없다.

"Не в обиду Аделине, она действительно молодец и заслужила медаль. Но если сравнивать ее прокат с Юной, даже произвольной, то у Юны катание пожалуй поувереннее и поэмоциональнее будет, но как говорится, сколько людей, столько и мнений"
"it only won gold because the scoring was botched, fu isu"
Its day 5 of 2023 and Im still pissed about her Gold medal win
강대국의 입김과 홈타운이라는 이점때문인가 .. 그전에 포디움 선적도 없고 표현력도 떨어지는데 그 이점들 때문에 최악의 기술에 가산점과 비약적인 pcs상승이라니 정말 😅

SHAME!!
"Юна Ким была великолепна, но программа у Сотниковой была технически сложней, даже с приземлением на две ноги!"
"На мой взгляд крайне непрофессионально в конце программы производить телодвижения типа « аплодируйте мне»или махать «мам, смотри ,я на олимпиаде». У неё же образ и она должна быть в нем до конца, а люди и так прохлопают и не надо им об этом говорить жестами. Не представляю, если бы кто-то из нынешних чемпионок начал так делать."
"Я уважаю каждого фигуриста, но это позор, Юлия Липницкая было в сто раз лучше, Юна Ким тоже"
"Anyone else see the common pattern here?? I don’t believe these young skaters are to blame, but the name change to ROC came about for a reason."
why she crying? after a series of two-foot jumps  🤣
Рекорд! Молодец Аделина Сотникова! ❤🎉
"근데 다시보니 웃긴게 지가뭐되는마냥
알고 날뛰는표정이 있었어…"
"Я вернулась спустя 10 лет, чтобы снова посмотреть прокат Аделины. Откатала она свою программу восхитительно. Золото заслуженное!"

А то что ущербные и  вырождающиеся западенцы  так реагируют на это Чудо--- вполне нормально: как по--другому может реагировать на Божественное  полностью сгнивший,  разложившийся и смердящий запад ?!!"

"Как все возмущаются, что обидели Юну. Не знаю, может быть и правы. Я не смотрела эту олимпиаду.
Но когда унижают, издеваются над российскими спортсменами, которые намного лучше многих других. Где вы все комментаторы?! Где ваша хваленая толерантность?! Ах, да, на русских она не распространяется.
Как унижали Ирину Слуцкую, Бережную, Валиеву и др. Яркий пример Аверины в художественной гимнастике. Золото отдали криворукой, которая и по технике уступает Дине. А здесь Сотникова даже не упала, а баллы набрала прыжками. Эти правила придумывали не российские судьи, а другие. Так что нечего пенять."
She is thief 🥷
What a boring performance 🙄

АДЕЛИНА суперрр!!!

"В двух элементах, дорожке шагов и заклоне, у Сотниковой был четвертый уровень сложности, у Ким – третий. Следовательно, только в этом Ким имела дефицит в один балл. В заклоне Сотникова с легкостью поддерживала скорость и высокую интенсивность. За это судьи отблагодарили ее оценками.

Так что за эти два элемента в сумме Сотникова получила преимущество в два балла. Итого, выполненные на высоком уровне каскад 2+3, дорожка шагов и заклон позволили ей выиграть 5,33 балла у Ким. По итогам двух программ их разделили 5,48."
이딴게 약빤 실력…?
뭔가 급해보이네 약속있냐?
신뢰없고 신의도없는 공산국가에서 당연한일 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그들에게서 무슨 공정을 논하겠나
this skate was so boring to watch that i was just reading the comments the entire time. yuna deserved the gold.
심사위원들 자격을 박탈했어야 한다. 이게 김연아 연기보다 뭐가 낫다는 건지....다시 봐도 착지도 불안정하고 연기도 미흡하고 두발로 착지하는 게 하나라도 있는데 뭐가 세계1위였다는건지..기술적인 요소에서 두발 착지면 -100을 줘도 모자라다고 본다.

"you can already see the difference between her and yuna, what a joke"
Imagine this kid seeing all the hate and comments she got after olympiad
There is no one more arrogant and self-confident than Yuna Kim fans
"Бедненькие обиженные корейцы все никак не могут простить Сотниковой ее абсолютно заслуженное золото и прекрасный заряженный прокат. Юна Ким со своим скучным нафталином времен где-то пост-Ванкувера должна быть вообще благодарна за серебро, и сказать спасибо Мао Асаде за ее провал к КП. Иначе в лучшем случае была бы у Юначки бронза. 
Аделина Сотникова - первая российская Олимпийская чемпионка в женском одиночном фигурном катании. А всех ваших престарелых кореянок и допубертатных юленек, разваливших личку, оставьте себе."

Adorable!!😍😘😘💛💝💚Bless Be cutie😘❤
Буря эмоций! Кураж!!! Мне очень нравится её прокат!

yuna won this not her :)
"Everybody's fine with Yuzuru falling a few times and still winning the gold, but raging about Sotnikova making a mistake (not even falling) and being the first. Her performance was stronger than Yuna's technical wise, and that's the reason she won, even considering that mistake."
길이길이 기억되는 우스꽝스러운 금메달
Unfair

It's not beautiful at all. Yunakim is the winner for playing with art

everyone talks about how horrid this performance is but no one talks about how abhorrent the musical arrangement or step sequence is

Adelina ce tânără așa de talentată

"Мне понравилась её программа. Я считаю, что победа честная ( всё таки жюри - это грамотные люди в своей сфере, которые могут правильно оценить прокат ). 
Если кто-то будет писать, что это невозможные баллы для этой фигуристки, то не соглашусь( у всех бывают взлёты,  как для Аделины этот жизненный прокат )."
"Kim Yuna lost the game, according to the real score, Kim Yuna is third place at best😂😂😂"
"The Sochi Olympics was clearly a battle between defining figuring skating as a sport or an art. Sport seems to have prevailed this time. I can't blame the judges for that decision, but personally I was sad to see Yuna win second. Still happy for Adelina"

А Юна, ваша любименькая девушка, украла серебро на Олимпийских играх! Очень плохо и ужасно поступили с Юлечкой Липницкой, девушка такую красоту на льду сотворила, а её только лишь на пятое место, даже в призёры не поставили , Юленька, кисонька моя любимая, я из всей любви к Аделине Сотниковой за тебя голубушка, за тебя девочка в красном пальто, хотелось бы чтобы жестокость Олимпийских игр исчезла, справедливость восторжествовала, Юлия Липницкая чемпионка, Аделина Сотникова серебрянный призёр, Юна ваша с которой вы носитесь как с писаной торбой, схватила только лишь бронзу, я не обзываю Юну , но давайте быть обьяктивнее, и не ставьте Аделину вечным занижением последней, никто не в праве распорядиться так жестоко , забрать у неё золото, отдать Юне, люблю Юну, но давайте не будем обзывать Аделину! Аделина Сотникова, ты победила, гордимся тобой! ❤🎉"

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Русские лгут.
😱
"Сейчас 2022 г. Олимпиада. Очень мне понравилась Аделина. Замечательная фигуристка. А вот Липницкая катала вообще без эмоций, а ведь у неё шикарная программа, образ и техника отличная. Сотникова более зрелая, артистичная, чемпионский прокат !"
"액을먹고도 기술력도 낮고 스텝연기도 낮다
게다기 김연아는 쇼츠도 점수가 높았다
러시아가 너 개구린거  도 보여준거"
약물사용..... 평생 양심에소리때문에 힘들거야.  인정해.
"это золото? ее движения такие неуклюжие,тупо все дорожки от прыжка до прыжка, программа какая то слабая и пустая. Сравнить с той же Липницкой, небо и земля😬"
"Best triple loop ever.
Kim couldn’t do this."
"Никто ее не помнит особо, но она чемпионка, Лепнитская всех тогда затмила"
"I never knew there were so many skating experts out there.
How is it I've never heard of any of you.
Hmmm"
Zhe best
"Завистники могут злословить, но: Самая Прекрасная и самая Жизнеутверждающая программа в фигурка!!"

Аделина чемпион!!!! Россия в перёд!!!
Браво!
It's a stage where there's no elegance even i tried look at it objectively. Her movements are stiff like a broken robot.

"Юна выступала без тренера - это её и подвело. Судейство прыжков изменилось, она этого не учла, и поплатилась золотой медалью. А Сотниковой выпал шанс, и она им воспользовалась."
그저 개거품 스케이팅 ㅋㅋ 존나못함
"Followers of Yuna, be humble. I understand that it is difficult for you to accept the reality in which your messiah is being thrown off the pedestal, but there is nothing surprising in the fact that it was a Russian girl who dropped her. If your Yuna tried to perform at the Russian Championship these days, she wouldn't even get into the top ten there."
웩
서커스 하는줄~~
Here to watch how bad she is . Sighhh

"Более невзрачного платья придумать нельзя, и это на домашней Олимпиаде 🙈 как тень на льду"
점프 착지가 완전 불안정한데 왜 금메달?
"People saying yuna is a victim? Adelina may have one gold but she’s now the most hated skater in the world for something she did. Just look at the comments, she’s probably broken. Yuna is still gaining fans and getting second didn’t affect her what so ever"
Это было сильно Первая👍

점프가 높네여 잘한다
왜 우러?  ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
약하고 한건 처벌해야한다. 하지만 심판이 경기결과에 대해서 편파판정한게 아닌것만은 확실하다.
this shows what it is like when an animal swallows more than she can
I do not understand why so many people hate on this performance?? I mean the girl was only 17 at the time and her routine showed a lot of personality and style. I liked it better than Yuna Kim tbh
🤭
This girl can dance!
"Any sports aside… 
HOW can a plain grey dress win gold???"
얘가 왜  금메달이었을까 ㅡㅡ
fake gold
отличное катание под очень сложную музыку
"Definitely deserved the gold, Much better then yuna who can’t even do a proper spiral or Biellmann"
✨✨✨👏👏👏💐💐💐
"Sotnikova didn't deserve the gold it should have Yuna then Carolina and Mao, Mao didn't fall anything and she did a beautiful 3A"
comedy lol ...shame on you
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk plz put the emotion
Typical Russian Act No Surprise😊
her elevating is faster and more wilder. i love my kim yeona but this time this skater won.
sotnikova is just 💀
All of you are horrible people. Honestly. This girl did not score herself. There is no need to flood the comments under this video and call her names. Go comment on Yuna's video.
Wrong edges and artistically directionless. It's unfortunate that her grossly overscored SP even put her within striking distance of the top 3
"Всё коменты против Сотниковой, написаны Кореей😂, свою жальче"
Молодец.
"sotnikova was much more dynamic and better, Kim supporters feels Kim should win because of previous accomplishment, but that's not how it works in skating competitions..you win on the performance of the day and on that day, sotnikova was much better than Kim."
"ジャンプの技術点の構成はキムヨナよりも上。
躍動感もあります。
ただ、表現力はキムヨナの方が美しいと思う。"
겨에 때 낌?
circus😍
"Смотря выступление Сотниковой сейчас, складывается странное ощущение. Вроде прокат чистый, все прыжки хорошо. Но на Аделине совсем нет эмоций… один открытый рот извините. С чемпионками после неё не сравнится конечно. Но Сотникова и Липницкая были «проводниками» для настоящей революции в фк на олимпиаде) После них наши девочки как ракеты стали занимать первые места 💪"
"Да!! Сколько невежд и недотеп в мире!! Сколько слепцов и глухонемых! И все лезут критиковать!! Нужно быть совершенно слепым и глухим,чтобы не увидеть блеск и радугу программы Аделины! Несть числа, тем ,кто унылую, неконтактную, сухую, закрытую, фоегматичную программу й Юны поставил выше Аделины...программа Аделины блистательна и изумительна !! Что Юна гений , никто не спорит, но только отпетый дятел и топор  не увидит, что Русская программа прекрасней и исполнена великолепно!!"
나라에 힘이 없어서 죄송합니다. ㅅ1발
Никакая
"""She was better than Yuna in this one, get over it."" Thank you W. Huang. Still so much butthurt after all these years. Everything you say about Sotnikova applies to Yuna, Yuna is the robot. Look at ""yuna kim short program ladies figure"" in the black dress yt window, so unaesthetic and stiff, like ""how do I skate?"" Every time yuna takes to the ice looks like the first time she ever skated. Stiff, no lines, no soul, no poetry. You're lucky she got the silver."

yuna's was much better
"чистый проигрыш Юне Ким, который все будут помнить и оценивать именно как проигрыш"
what an amazing skater...gold medal 100% deserved.
아무도 기억하지 않는 올림픽 금메달리스트.
She like a robot
"wow no quad jumps in this performance. next generation russian skaters elevates quality to high rise. quad queens sasha trusova, kamila valieva and anna scherbakova"
사람들이 욕하길래 얼마나 형편없나 보러왓더니 솔직히 3연속 점프 할때 마지막 점프에서 착지 실수말고는 다 잘했구만 왜...?? 더 난이도 높은 기술 여러개 했으니 실수 한번해도 점수 더 높은거겠지
"People don't forget, this is a competition and not a popularity ride. These comments are not fair. She was better than Yuna in this one, get over it."
Sotnikova the best
"yuna kim can t do triple axel neither quads , so she is not the best skater ever .. she can barely do triple/triple combination.  when it comes to artistically matter, she can t beat medvedeva !! what medvedeva produce is real Art !!"
it is pretty obvious that her skating is much better than others including Kim Yuna.
"Бедная Аделина, какие люди завистливые и злые. Она чисто откала, прыгала чисто и высоко. Но столько хейта в её сторону от иностранцев. Хотя и сейчас олимпиада в Пекине и все равно хейтят наших спортсменов, хотя они на голову выше."
韓国の買収に疑問をもって事前に韓国人からひどい質問を受けてもきちんと記者に対応したソトニコワ選手、優勝おめでとう🥇
Lots of negative reviews here about Sotnikova. It's so stupid. you are like offended children. Sotnikova deserved to win
Аделина красиво прыгает
Технически Сотникова была сильнее  и вращения были сильными . Юна Ким нужно было усложнить программу. Но она такого не сделала .
Аделина Сотникова топ
sotnikova is much better.
