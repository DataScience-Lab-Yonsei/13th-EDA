"It's 2020, let's all admit that we're simps for Yuzuru"
"This man:
- survived from the earthquake in 2011
- leaving home to canada and struggling with communication at 16
- Asthma problems causing stamina issues 
- asthma attack 2 weeks before winning 2017 worlds 
- champion 3 months after an ankle injury that could’ve ruined his career
- and so so so many injuries 


Yet he never stops trying, challenging, and being Yuzuru Hanyu. He’s truly the strongest fighter and never uses his weaknesses as excuses. He does everything to be the best of himself. GOAT"
How can he look so masculine & cute at the same time
"メダリストを読んでやっとこの人のすごさに気づいた…もっと早く知って現役の時に追いたかったな…
元々氷の上のプリンセスという小説で少しはフィギュアスケートについて知っていたけどメダリストでさらに厳しくシビアで報いがあるかもわからない過酷な世界だと知りました
本当にすごく努力をしてきたんだなぁと…もはや化け物を見た気分です"
He makes it look like the music is following him instead of him performing to the music
"this guy is like a prince 
edit: you guys are awesome, thanks for the likes"
Even his name sounds so cool.
とある漫画を読んでから見てみると「うお〜なんかすげ〜」と思ってた感想が、こいつ化け物だろ！に変わった。天才という言葉では例えられない領域の人間じゃねえのゆずるん。スケートの映像で感動する日が来るとは思わなんだ
He was born to make history.
"He protecc 
He atacc
But most importantly
He won two gold medals bacc to bacc"
When you realize this was a performance of a man who had a career ending injury 3 months before the olympics and started to train his quads just 2-3 weeks before the competition
"当時母と自分が羽生くんのオタクだったから、この演目もリアタイしてたけど、
メダリストのお陰で改めてどれだけ難しい演技をしているのか分かって、リアタイできた喜びと技名が判断できるようになって嬉しい"
"He's beauty, he's grace,he can do a triple axel and land on your face."
you could literally feel his passion overpowering his pain.
Yesterday he announced his retirement. I love this Legend. He was on the throne for 12 years.
漫画アニメにどハマりして見にきたけどすげぇな…実際の演技を見るとこういうことなんだと思うけどこういうことができるのすごい…（語彙力
The best thing is that he uses Japanese traditional seimei music. Bringing his national culture to the world.
Let's just admit that Hanyu is our hidden crush.
I have a serious crush.
"私もメダリストというアニメから辿り着きました。
平昌冬季五輪の時の羽生選手のことは知っていて、すごいな・・・程度にしか思っていなかったけど、メダリストのアニメを見て、改めて羽生選手のすごさを再認識した。
漫画およびアニメ「メダリスト」はフィギュアスケートってこれだけ面白いんだと教えてくれる良い作品ですね。"
When he dragged his hand on the ice with the upper violin chord - beautiful
he's literally THE main character
I just got this randomly recommended to me and I don’t know who this guy is but he seems awesome and everyone’s simping for him
"「メダリスト」という漫画の影響でフィギュアスケートの映像を見まくってるんですが、この素晴らしき不世出の天才をリアルタイムで追えなかったのか………
あ～、人生やり直してぇ〜………"
Japan is lucky to have this guy
I could see his passion overcoming his pain.
*can we just talk about how good looking he is?*
"It's been six years, and still, no one has surpassed this Yuzuru's iconic Seimei performance."
Okay but can we talk about all his outfit designs he's always dressed so well
"Gee this guy is amazing, even his mistakes didn't look like mistakes"
"A dancer, an artist, an athlete , truly a beautiful skater"
"フィギュアスケートはルールが難しいとか、
ジャンプの見分けができないなどで、
とっつきづらいと思われる人が多いけど、
わかればわかるほど、どういうジャンプが正しくて難しくて美しいのか、
なぜこのスケーターの演技は圧倒的に感動するのかなどがわかってきて、
凄く面白いし深いのです。"
You’re saying this guy’s ankles were nearly dead but he could still do this whole performance and NOT fall on the floor??????
"He did this masterpiece after a career threatening injury, on painkillers, on a sprained ankle, and jumping quads for only 2/3 weeks. YOUR FAVS COULD NEVER."
It's funny because everyone always cheers for their home countries during the Olympics....but I honestly don't think there was a single person on the planet who wasn't rooting for this kid.
漫画を見てきた、リアルタイムで見ていなかったのが悔しいってコメント見て、なんだかとても嬉しくなった、本当に良いものは何年経っても再評価される
"(Not very) fun fact: Yuzu had injured his ankle really badly before the Olympics, and lost several months of preparation almost until a few weeks before the competition. He decided to go back to training using painkillers, and is using them even in this performance. Also, during the practice before this, he couldn't land a single quad. But miraculously, he landed them when it really mattered. To me, his mental fortitude is just as impressive as the beautiful skating."
i wonder how much pain he's carrying every time he lands. obviously clear during slowmo how uncomfortable placement those feet are
"Doesn't your back hurt?
For carrying the whole figure skating industry alone.

edit: and he is going to Beijing 2022! hoping he will make another history written in his name."
"陰陽師の映画が大好きだからそのサントラとイメージ衣装で踊ってくれたのが当時めちゃくちゃ嬉しかったなぁ…
それを抜きにしていつ見てもすごすぎる"
"Important fact for any newbies here: it was 4 months after a really serious ankle injury and Yuzu skate on painkillers. 
And obviously it was his first competition after that injury, so no one knew if he okay or not."
"It's not easy being a fan of Yuzuru Hanyu.

* He gets injured/ill in almost every season of his senior career.
* Insisting to compete while injured/ill. 
     1. Worlds 2012 - sprained ankle
     2. Worlds 2013- flu
     3. COC 2014- collission with Han Yan resulting in multitude of injuries.
     4. NHK 2014- just 2 weeks after COC thus still unhealed. The only time he was out of the podium since winning GPF 2013.
     5. Japan Nationals 2014- competed while oozing blood and pus on the abdomen from a bladder birth defect. Bound his abdomen with bandage and duct tape to avoid ruining his costume. He was rushed to the hospital immediately after the competition.
       6. Japan Nationals 2016- He withdraw due to flu.
        7. Worlds 2016- He didn't inform his coach that he was experiencing pain on his foot since the beginning of the season. Still competed the whole GP breaking World records back 2 back. He exacerbated his injuries resulting to a meltdown of an FP in Worlds. He was diagnosed with Lisfranc injury. He seriously thought it was the end of his carreer.
     8. NHK 2017- went to OP while feverish. Tried jumping quad lutz, fell hard, damaging his ankle ligaments severely. He withdraw from competing.
       9. Olympics 2018- After a news blackout for months, he showed up in Korea reassuring everyone that he's now feeling okay to compete. He successfully defended his olympic title, only to announce later that he's still not yet 100% recovered and that he only got through the competition with the help of pain medications. He withdraw from Worlds 2018 to recuperate.
        10. Rostelecom Cup 2018-  He reinjured the same ankle while trying to jump the quad loop in practice. Still insisted on competing. Went to podium to get his gold medal wearing crutches.

I really can't believe that I wrote this huge wall of text just to whine about the agony of being a fanyu and list each and every one of Yuzu's propensity in ignoring his well-being. But who am I kidding? Even if he's this reckless, I still support him because he is a good man and I want to see how much farther he can go with his dreams despite having body limitations. He is a huge inspiration."
Can we talk about how much precious his smile is. Even after those little mistakes he's so calm and still having fun. I'd be panicking if i was him which is impossible
最近『メダリスト』読んでるから羽生さんってマジで上手いんだなって思う
"He is the main character. We are all side characters, living in Yuzu's world."
"To the people who get this video recommended to you 10 years later, 
He’s a legend in this sport, his jumps are perfect, he’s as graceful as a swan, and he’s our crush"
This performance hits different when I realised he was injured beforehand. You wouldn't even think that with the way he's skating. It's so beautiful and I admire his resilience.
"自分も「メダリスト」からの影響でこの動画を見返してますが、当時も思っていたけどやっぱり羽生君は身体のラインや動きもすごくしなやかで曲に溶け込んでいて、まさに「気づいたらとんで、降りていた」という表現がふさわしいくらいに自然で綺麗な演技だと思いました。
最近は過去の存在のようでTikTokなんかでも叩かれているのを見かけますが、どんなにアンチが湧いてこようと羽生君は日本の宝ですね。"
"""He's more than an athlete, he's an artist."""
it's absolutely jaw-dropping that yuzuru was able to accomplish that level of technicality while stomaching the definite pain he was facing in his right ankle.
If anybody wonders why he had trouble with some landings it’s because he had a busted ankle and stopped receiving treatment before skating at the Olympics. Don’t hate on him for that this was one of his best performances yet.
本当にジャンプしてんのかよってぐらい流れが綺麗だな
"Man they didn't exaggerate even a bit in yuri on ice, ice skating is literally that aggressive and beautiful"
The fact this video came out 4 years ago yet there are people actively commenting to this day just shows you how much of an incredible performance this was
"they should make an anime about him and about his life stories, like you know dedicated anime for him"
"Summer Olympic is happening, but I miss our Winter Olympic legend Yuzuru Hanyu."
"Yuzuru is a truly hero, a legendary skater, and a Prince of the ice. He is a born skater.  He survived the 2011 March 11 earthquake and Tsunami, when his family had to sleep in a small space and eat small rice balls distributed by the shelter, unable to go to skate for many days. He yet moved around the country, seeking a chance to skate, not for games but for his own challenges and for his love for the people who suffered from the loss of lives and housing. Even now he continues donating most of his awards and funds received for his championships to his native town every year.  His skating is not just a game but it is his soul, his life, and his love for the people, ice rink, and his family. That is why his skating has everything about a human love, beautiful and great reflection of his being himself."
"At this moment, he was competing with an unhealed injury and was on painkillers. As he passes into the second half, you could see that he was fighting the excruciating pain in his desperate attempts to land the remaining quads. Considering he already has asthma and with a weakened ankle, to endure the painful landings and not even touch the ice during the slight stumbles, it was simply his golden resilience, the burning desire to defend his medal and his unbeatable passion and love for the sport. 
I may not be the only one to say this, but we are seeing a living legend...and though I may never be able to see him in person, I am just truly happy to live in the same generation as Yuzuru Hanyu. <3 Rest well, champion...heal your injuries and get back on the ice without having to endure anymore pain. God bless him."
His costume reminds me of Haku from Spirited Away for some reason. It's really magical.
おすすめに出てきたので久々に見たら、なぜだか涙が出てきた。本当に素晴らしい、見るものの心を揺さぶる演技をする方だなと思う
"if you're ever feeling down, remember that you were blessed to be alive at the same time as yuzuru hanyu."
"idk why people say figure skating is boring. something about figure skating is so satisfying to watch, especially to good, captivating music like this. bravo 👏"
I saw a prince dancing in a fairy forest
何十回、観ても感動します。五輪二連覇のあの日を今でも鮮明に覚えています。羽生結弦選手、素晴らしい演技をありがとうございます。大好きなプログラムです。RE_PRAY 宮城公演を楽しみにしていますので頑張って下さい。応援しています。
I can't even fanthom how many hours of training and what a huge amount of talent one needs to make those crazy moves look so natural and fluid.
He's so good at skating that he failed two jumps and still won. That's talent right there.
I don't usually watch ice skating but this is so beautiful????
今見ても、漫画を超えた存在だと思うよ羽生さん…
4:33... when he glided his hand over the ice like that......... absolutely mesmerizing. yuzuru hanyu is unbelievably good.
His coach jumping for joy when he landed a spin at 7:50 is so pure.
"12 senior seasons, 19 world records, first to break the 100, 200, and 300 point barrier, the only men’s single skater who has ever completed the Super Slam, and the first to land the 4Lo, 4T3A, 4Teu3F in competition. One and only, the goat, the legend, Yuzuru Hanyu. Thank you for everything!"
"伝説だよ、この演技は
後世まで語り継がれてほしい"
"Being in this competitive field for 18 years, and rightfully dominating it ever since- despite obstacles coming his way- yuzu is such a legend."
First time watching him but it's like he is telling the story of a young prince and his first time in battle. So beautiful.
"Sometimes I forget Yuzu’s routines are mathematically put together to garner as much points as possible. He maximizes the points while still making it artistic, musical, and emotional astounds me."
still crushing on him in 2024😞
Let’s all admit it even if it’s your first time seeing Yuzuru you all ready have a crush on him 😌
I wasn't interested in figure skating at all until I saw him in Beijing. I was crying while watching him. It was so beautiful
"When the time comes that Hanyu retires, I dream of seeing his last performance personally so I can cry with everyone in the stadium after."
授業時間中にも関わらずテレビで見せてくれた当時の先生に感謝
The guy is a living legend and Japan's national treasure and some people think he's popular just because of yoi. smh
"imagine being hot, tall, dark haired, japanese, having one of the coolest names in the world, fit, nice butted, can figure skate, are the best at it, have the determination to work really hard despite being injured and having asthma, earn gold in the figure skating olympics, and look like an anime boy....
HE'S the REAL anime protagonist."
I love how people are finding out this video and about yuzu recently.. WELCOME TO THE FANDOM. If you want to ask anything us FANYUs would be glad to help you out in getting to know yuzuru. He deserves the world!
漫画の影響でとりあえずフィギアスケートって調べて見まくってるが、親がハマっていて一緒にこの時の滑りをテレビで見てたはずなのに、今やっと見て楽しむということが出来るようになった。リアタイで追えてればもっと楽しかったんだろうな。
"that cry in the end as he embraced coach Brian    ""its so hard"" -- poor baby, his ankle must have hurt so much while he was doing those 2nd half jumps."
fun fact that inhale at the start is his own voice that he recorded and put in to help remind him to breathe before his FS
"the way he smiles as he soars on the ice… he is truly a master of this art. a living legend. forever my favorite skater. thank you for everything, yuzu!"
後にも先にも羽生くんこそ氷上の王子様だったな
"No matter how many times you watch this, it is always mesmerizing."
"His footwork and technique are so incredibly clean, it looks as though he is effortlessly gliding"
"Not only handsome, but he so talented.."
放送当時、録画を何回も何回も見てた。当時私は小6で正直オリンピックにもそんなに興味はなかったけど、羽生くんの演技だけは絶対に見るくらい好きだった。晴明は羽生くんの持つ雰囲気や綺麗な滑りが本当に良く活かされていて、全てに目が惹きつけられる。私ももう大学生になりましたが、何回見ても感動してしまいます。
"Love him or hate him, for whatever reason, you have to admit how strong and technically gifted he is. Or perhaps gifted is not the right word since he works so hard. He performed a program of this caliber and ended up winning gold whilst nursing an injury!"
"This is pure beauty.

I’m not into skating but got this in my recommendations.
I had no idea who Yuzuru was. And I do not regret clicking on this video.

I literally started crying when he was done. Wow!"
Why does he seem like a protagonist
"За все время мужского фигурного катания ,скольжение ,Юдзуру  Ханю ,никто не превзошел.
❤"
4:35 that's the most beautiful scene i've ever seen
Don't call him Yuri on Ice!!!!!!! YUZURU IS YUZURU!!!!!
"This is not sport, this is pure artistry. His artistic presence is overwhelming. The choreography deserves a special mention too, absolutely stunning."
「メダリスト」の影響でスケート見始めたしジャンプも見分けられるようになった。フィギュアって面白いのな。
"2 months off the ice, skating this on painkillers... 
This is strength. He deserved this gold like nobody else."
This scene right here at 4:34 is just simply one of the most mesmerizing scenes of anything I've ever watched.
No words. He's is the best.
"プロスケーターとしてわずかこの2年半で
彼が成し遂げたことも、すでにとんでもない偉業だと思います。
彼は固定観念や保守的思想を壊して、新しい世界を切り開く天才です。"
"Everyone is secretly having a crush on him, both men and women. He's the best."
I'm here to say how badly I wish him gold in Olympics 2022. It's just because he is the only one truly Figure Skater but not an ordinary jumper.
Yuzuru Hanyu is the perfect example of how figure skating should be done. He is the standard.
6 years cant stop watching this
no homo but he's very handsome and cute tho
7:55 that guy in the back is literally mood everytime I watch Yuzuru Hanyu
"I've always preferred women's figure skating competitions. In men, I often missed this lightness and subtlety. Ever since I discovered Yuzuru - I have found what I have always been looking for. Yuzu is complete figure skater with a perfect technique plus this freedom of movement and delicacy. For me, he has always been and will be the greatest skater of all the time."
This skate must go in history as the BEST.
"Omfg... I just learn that he did all that while asthmatic and not fully recovered from an injury. Everything was beautifully executed, even the mistakes. Mind blown."
"5 years later and he'll be skating at Tokyo Dome to thousands, and it's now streaming worldwide! he deserves the world"
"Yuzuru is literally mesmerizing to watch. He looks so ethereal on the ice, beautiful yet deadly. The way he moves isn’t even human, it’s the pure epitome of hypnotizing grace."
彼の演技はスポーツではなく芸術。もう二度と現れないだろう。
I found him just 20 mins ago and I love him already!!
I love seeing people discover Yuzuru for the first time. Welcome to the fandom!!! Enjoy watching his performances while you can :)
I love how everyone just starts throwing Winnie the Pooh bears after he finishes
"何度観ても感動しますね、祈りながら観ていたのを昨日の事のように思い出します。
競技を退いた今も尚自ら紡ぐアイスショーで多くの人を魅了し続けている。彼をリアルタイムで応援出来る奇跡に心から感謝したい。"
It feels like he is flying !!! 😍
The KING. No one can even come close to him. He's simply the best of all times.
"He is just different. He is the artist, the music, the soul that brings Every performance alive. Simply mesmerizing...
Goodbye Legend, thank you for those memories, u make Figure skating become art😞"
"even after 6 years, he still continues to be an inspiration!"
I can only imagine the tears and sweat and maybe even blood he’s shed for years of practice to master his skating skills.  Bravo.
"I regretted so much that I only knew him this year, IM SO PROUD OF HIM THO"
"Its already great watching it on its own, but when you know the story behind all of it, the injury, the pain killers, the pressure, dang, the program becomes 10x more awesome."
"ダントツの視聴回数！
これからも見続けられる演技。"
So disappointed not seeing Yuzuru Hanyu as a one of the torch bearer during the Tokyo Olympic opening ceremony...He is the embodiment of what Olympic spirit is about
man that was ELEGANT
"Not gonna lie, I'm starting to become a fan after this video."
"こんなにも沢山の人に勇気や力を与えてくれてありがとうございます自分もその1人です😢
日本のレジェンドでいてくれてありがとう🥺ྀི🥺ྀི"
"I don't mean to offend other figure skaters and their fans, but seeing other skates make me realize just how amazing Yuzuru is. You get used to his transitions, elegance in landing jumps, choices of when he jumps to match the music, and so much more that some skates honestly look a bit bland and unimpressive. I mean, that should probably be obvious because he's always scoring and ranking high, but it really just hits you how there _is_ a difference between the best of the bests and others."
It's almost like he's painting calligraphy with the blades of his skates. So so beautiful! The music is so captivating. He belongs to another world during this performance.
"Today is my 77th birthday and the greatest gift that I can give myself is to watch Yuzu. I live in Kansas USA and watched figure skating for many years and I love any skating that Yuzu performs. To me, he is the GOAT and will always be in my lifetime.  I am so fortunate to have lived  during his skating years."
仙台住みだがいつも神社に行くと羽生くんの健康を祈る絵馬が国問わず本当に多くあって愛されてるなと感じる
"Dear COVID, 
2022 Olympics might be Yuzu's last olympics, so pls go away. Pooh is waiting to shine once again."
Why did I just fell in love with a man I’ve known for literally 7 minutes istg
"Magnificent performance, I will never forget this Olympics. Both his SP and FP are masterpieces. In addition to his brilliant skating, Yuzuru Hanyu has this inimitable aura that nobody else possesses. What an athlete!"
"今でも定期的に見に来ます
やっぱり羽生くんのスケーティングは美しい"
"オリンピックという舞台で陰陽師を選びこの衣装と曲で魅せるスケーティングで戦ってくれたの伝説すぎる
4:22 の音ハメ脳汁でる"
"顔、スタイル、演技、人間性が全てにおいて秀でている。。
神様に選ばれた人。。。"
This never gets boring
"例え回転数の多いジャンプを跳んでノーミスしようとも
無機質な演技では点数だけで誰の心にも記憶にも残らない。
彼はスケートに魂を込められる人。"
I wanna see him winning Olympic gold medal again for third time
"He ruined ice skating for me 








I can't watch other people because he set the bar so high"
winning gold after only being back to practicing quads for two weeks.... what even is he?? Its amazing he managed to produce this level of a FS!
"この時からもう6年も経っているのに、
あなたはこの時よりずっと技術は進化し、
表現はますます芸術的です。
競技時代には封印していた才能を解放し、常に新しい風を取り込み、
今でも魔法のような瞬間を私たちに見せてくれます。
これからもずっと応援し続けます!"
"Have to watch this again after Beijing. No one skates with so much artistry, musicality and presence as Hanyu. Most just go through the motions, nearly on beat, but Yuzuru is always one with the music and choreography. He’s an incredible athlete, but he’s an artist like no other!"
この先どんなすごいジャンプを飛べるスケート選手が出てきても、ハイレベルなステップを披露する選手が出てきても、羽生選手の偉大さが薄れることは決してないと思います。こういう人をレジェンドというんだろうなと
its been 5 years but im still here
whenever i watch him skate ..he makes me feel some kind of way i cant put it in words
There will never be another skater like Yuzuru Hanyu. Never. 👑👑👑
素人にもわかるくらい表現力がずば抜けてるすごい
Watching Yuzuru Hanyu skate is never boring. He knows artistry + smooth jumps.. A TOTAL PACKAGE
こんな人を引き込むパフォーマンスはもう彼しかできない。どれかスポーツどれか芸術という切り離すのは無理です。この競技はあってこそとっぜつもない創造を誕生させた!
this man smooth as butter
he really give off such a intoxicating aura on the ice. it’s insane how incredible he is
"""Thank you, right foot. Thank you, ice.""

He's just amazing! 😍😍😍"
国籍を問わず、日本文化の世界観が受け入れられた瞬間でもありました。羽生選手の成し遂げた偉業です。感謝
日本の誇りやでほんまに
"今回メダルには届かなかったけど、挑戦する姿が素敵でした。
周りに期待されているメダルよりも自分がしたいと思える4回転を貫き通したことに拍手を送りたいです。
今回も感動をありがとうございました。"
"Oh, how I miss him in competitions. His grace is outstanding and I haven't seen any other ice skater having such an aura, precision and movement. He was absolute top of his kind. In comparison to him other ice skaters look so stiff."
После стольких лет? - Всегда! Пересматриваю этот прокат и программу. Ничего лучше в фигурном катании не было и не будет. Этот вид спорта очень многое потерял без Юдзуру
"I realized something after watching Olympic 2022: Lots of talented skaters out there, they also won the Olympics championship and broke the world records as Yuzuru did, but I swear their performance is all just technically, currently still no one can perform so beautiful, artistry, full of emotion and touches to the hearts of the audience like Yuzuru. He is a living legend, a treasure of figure skating. I'm so sad thinking someday he'll retire, he's set my standard for figure skating athlete so high already, how can I ever admire anyone else after him?"
"If you’re not a fan of figure skating, skip to 4:14 and try not to get hype from how freaking awesome the next minute is"
Watched this to cleanse myself from the fuckery that was 2019 worlds
"Here again to recharge my soul with this masterpiece, this living amazing and genuine YUZURU HANYU, KINF OF FIGURE SKATING, KING OF ICE."
"I was sick when I started watching this video, and by the time I got to the end I was completely cured"
"I only just became a fan of Yuzuru during the Beijing Olympics and have spent the past two months binge watching his past competitions, performances, press conferences, documentaries and fan compilations. What a supreme athlete, all-around artist and beautiful human being -- a rare and pure existence in this chaotic world! It is such a privilege to get to know, support and love him and follow his journey. I have also tried watching other skaters of the current generation, males, females, pairs, but they all come across as ordinary and almost ""juvenile"" compared to Yuzuru, regardless of the jumps, scores or medals. There is a spiritual quality in Yuzuru's skating which has turned my admiration for him almost into some sort of religious fervor. It is an incredible sensation that I have never experienced and I very much cherish."
何度みても鳥肌立つ。特にラストストレートラインステップに入るところなどは言葉にならない。心が震える。力強く美しくどこまでも麗しい。彼の血の滲む努力の結晶であり、いちプログラムを超え、もはや芸術の域。苦しい時に、いつも勇気づけられています。
"He didn't just skate, he putted his soul on ice and made his skate a masterpiece."
"The synchronization with the music at 4:22, the look on Yuzuru's face, and everything that comes after is so memorizing. It will forever be one of my favorite moments in skating."
"*2021 and YUZURU HANYU IS STILL A LIVING, BREATHING, STILL COMPETING, FIGURE SKATING LEGEND*"
私が思うに、羽生君は観客から見られてる方がより自信に溢れてる感じがするしノリに乗れてる気がする。どの大会でもジャンプ決めた時や堪えた時にその場の観客に見せつけてやった感があるし、何より歓声が大きな原動力になってると思う.....。てことで、コロナ早く消えてくれまた観客アリの演技が見たい
tbh....i cried....this performance.....let's just say that no one could forget this
"There's nothing more than this in figure skating, Yuzuru is already a legend."
"It always amazes me how i thought no one can top to this seimei but just after 4years, yuzu skates to seimei again in beijing with even more higher difficulty, speed, the technicality. Truly shows what he said before ""i am my only rival"""
いまだに見にきちゃうし何回見ても鳥肌が止まらないし最後のステップ始まる瞬間に涙止まらなくなる
"even now, after so many years i still come back to watch his performances. glad to see new fans emerging to watch him because of medalist but i wish more people noticed him earlier. as someone who's been following hanyu-san's career for over almost 15 now, even after he retired from competing, his performaces always brings a smile on my face."
I probably contributed 100 of the 27M views here…let’s keep going it will just be a matter of time before it hits 30M
"People should make a film about him 😭 how he overcome the accident, how he overcome his fear, how he found figure skating... It’ll be very motivating"
"he surpassed everyone who came before him in figure skating. He is the pride of this world, a genius"
"もうこんなにも素晴らしいスケーターはあらわれない！
何度観ても感動します！！
この演技は永遠に刻まれ永遠に伝えられていく演技です！"
Just came here to remind myself that he doesn’t have to do anything else to prove he’s the GOAT. They can’t take away this from him no matter how hard they try. This will be forever legendary
The cultural elements to his moves are wonderful and such a tribute to his heritage!
I hope this comment gets a lot of likes so it can be pushed to the top. Film production units please contact Yuzuru to make a documentary about his life and career so that audiences all over the world can see his playing time. I will be crazy happy. I am a fan from Vietnam
"羽生結弦のこのパフォーマンスをリアルタイムを見られたことに感謝しています。
最初から最後まで素晴らしかったし、ミスしても転ばずに耐えていて流石だと思いました。
いつまでも応援しています。"
"I don't know what was more impressive, his perfect +3GOE jumps or spectacular saves XD"
I watch this everyday before I study. It gives me motivation
"I don't think I've ever seen a better Men's program, mistakes or not. There's something utterly spellbinding about it. Hanyu's a true champion."
観るたびにあの日の感動が蘇ります。
"Honestly,  I've never been so mesmerized by any ice skating performance as I've been with Hanyu's. He's a true artist, has such a graceful aura when he's performing. It's hard to believe he retired but if he's happy, I'm happy too"
I'm glad i live in the same generation with Hanyu
Yuzuru Hanyu is the GOAT of figure skating. Nobody won't ever be able to leave the Same impact on people like him. So happy he went for his goal by trying a 4A instead of a medal in the Beijing 2022 Olympics. you are the greatest and so loved all over the world ❤️

"there will be never like him anymore, the era had gone. And he will be the one in history"
"Im not a big fan of jumps, im more a spin and coreography kind of viewer. AND THAT LIGHT AND SOFT TOUCH ON THE ICE WITH HIS HAND WAS THE BOMB!( 04:36) Awesome performance! BUT dont go directly to 04:30 to see it, go at least 04:00 WITH SOUND to get the right mood!"
I love how supportive and excited his coaches are when he’s skating. Especially when the one jumps at 7:55 .
羽生結弦選手の演技はいつ観ても感動する。これを今、単独公演Echoes のアンコールでも見せて頂き感謝しています。今が一番上手い羽生結弦選手大好きです。向上心の塊で日々進化し続けているプロアスリート。
"He really gave it his all, even with the injury and limited preparation. As Brian Orser said, ""He’s used to trusting his training, what he had in the bank. But he had nothing in the bank. So it was trust his spirit, and it was a neat way to approach it at the end."""
"It's different from other players who are obsessed with the number of jumps and only want to score points.
Hanyu is the best figure skater."
"今日の羽生くんの演技を見てここに来たら同じ思いでコメントを残している方がたくさんいて嬉しくなりました。
日本だけではなく各国の方からの羽生くんに対する熱い思いを読んで胸が熱くなりました！！"
He's incredible! To be champion after so many injuries.... this guy is a warrior!
"I have a very important exam for me tomorrow, maybe an exam that will change my life... and I've been studying for this exam for 2 years, watching yuzu has always given me strength, inspired me... and now that I've spent my whole year watching it, I've taken it one last time before my exam. I wanted to watch it one more time :))
I want to leave a mark on life like him in the future 🫧🫧"
I'm just happy that there are people here just discovering Yuzu this year and being mesmerized by his gracefulness
Gold or not Yuzuru Hanyu will always be the champion for me. And this performance always will remain  legendary.
このオリンピックのSPとフリー何年ぶりかにして見ました。やっぱりどれだけ時が経とうと、色褪せない魂の演技、素晴らしい。
"I discovered Yuzuru by mistake  clicking on this video years ago  now i'm a huge fan he's SO mesmerizing and beautiful the amount of passion and love he has for Ice skating is admirable, The Ice King"
"This is phenomenal and out of the world. He is polite on screen and off screen. He has great grades. He excels in sports (especially ice figure skating) . He has accomplished so much at this age. Thinking back, what are WE doing at his age? Prob sitting around on the coach watching tv or doing homework or something (no offense to everyone) Yuzuru is a true role model for pursuing your dreams and is a person anyone would have to be glad to call a child of theirs"
"The thing about yuzuru is his other worldly artistry. Artistry is often ignored and considered 'back up' score. Yes it is exciting to see skaters land a jump clean, but it doesn't make audience cry. Artistry does. For him jumps and quads are just bonus. Audience is already moved to tears by his artistry and emotion. That's what make a performance memorable. 
And if he lands all his jumps clean, he wins the competition and break one or two world record. That's why he has so many fans. Not because all his fans are japanese or all the audience is japanese. I hate the media always ignore his international fans' existence."
"the choreography were so strikingly beautiful and breathtaking, he appeared more like a spirit than a human."
"One thing about Yuzuru, he really uses music, literally trying to blend himself with it thoughtfully not just using it for background music. He’s the artist."
どんな競技でもそうだけどやっぱり歓声の力って凄いんだな..
"""Yuzuru Hanyu is the biggest star of the Olympic channel, not just in Japan but everywhere"" (Yiannis Exarchos, the Olympic Channel Services executive director)"
He is a true legend. Will never tire of watching this!
This will go down in history as one of the most iconic moments. Great Olympic moment!
Everything about this performance is amazing but his big smile at the beginning of the last steps sequence and the energy that comes out of it makes it unforgettable.
4:22 THAT step sequence and hydroblade really got me on the knees and bawling. So beautiful. Will never be bored. I’ve watched this video 10x more already
"今観ても凄いしか言葉が出ません。
羽生結弦さんのジャンプは完璧でしょう⛸"
"Honestly, if it wasn't for Yuzuru, I don't think i'll be into figure skating like i am now. His performances are just sooo mesmerizing?? Like his movements, his choreography, his jumps, he just makes them look so natural. He's just so talented and amazing!!! Seimei is definitely my favorite program by him, and for him to do it almost flawlessly, makes me admire him even more due to his injury. Yuzuru, we will all be here waiting for you when you are healed because you are the GOAT!!!"
"Am i the only one who came here over and over, watch his performance and enjoy reading all the comments appreciating this materpiece?"
"One day, there will be a movie about this legend. 💙"
He's such an legendary human being
I didn't search for any Olympic/ice skating video and YT just recommended this for me and since then I am addicted to Yuzuru!
"the Greatest program of All Time performed by the GOAT, without doubt. so graceful and technically magnificent. Yuzu's resilience and strength is simply inspirational."
He won gold as soon as he walked onto the ice
"every single move hes like a sweeping yet gentle wind its just so unbelievably emotional. he commands and is gravity; he doesnt get moved by any force, he flows in the direction he pleases and its almost like he can move wind itself
 i love how he engages every limb and makes such beautiful silhouette shapes like hes in control of everything, hes so agile"
"Yuzu’s first opening jumps ( the 4S and the 4T) got perfect GOE. +3’s all across the board. He also got perfect GOE on his 3A and he StSq yesterday with his SP. No other male skater got perfect GOE this entire competition and considering he did this with a not fully healed ankle, he truly is the GOAT."
"He is more than a skater. He is an artist. He is so special that he will never be replaced or forgotten. Yuzu, we just want you to know that there are so many people around the world who appreciate your amazing programs and get inspired by your noble qualities."
Idk why? But i cant feel the gracefullness of every movement from other performers like the way he did. From the body movements hand gestures facial expression he was able to transcend his emotion to the audience. He's not just an athlete but also an artist.❤
演技なのに演技に見えないのは、羽生君の魂が入り、皆の心が惹かれるからでしょうね。さすがです！
"It doesn't feel like he's trying hard, he looks relaxed like he's just skating at his backyard. Every one of his move looks relaxed and part of him. Perfection"
I prefer a thousand times someone like yuzuru hanyu who takes full risks with his program even injured and making a few mistakes than taking it safe and it paid off he got the GOLD
Skated like this with a busted ankle with only three weeks' training prior to the Olympics.. this guy is unbelievable.
かっこいいもう本当に1人の人生の物語の映画を見た気持ちになる
"4:25 this part. It's so bright, warm, triumphant, and dramatic. It's like the spotlight's only on him and the world is watching with bated breath. He's just so unreal."
"(here 7/9/24)Sad I found him after retirement but I am glad I found out about his existence. I love watching him, I have been obsessed with him since I found him a few days ago, watching countless videos of him."
"I’m so proud to be a Japanese living in Japan and so lucky to have Yuzuru Hanyu, the greatest skating king. His jump, skating, spin....everything he creates on the ice is sooo great, elegant, and gorgeous. When he won the gold medal at PyeongChang Olympics, I couldn’t stop shedding my tears for this happiest moment. Thank you, Yuzuru. You’re my legend forever."
たくさんの日本人金メダリストがいるけど羽生くんはまさに日本の至宝。唯一無二。卓越した心技体、進化を求めて今も努力忍耐を重ねてる。なによりありえないほどの二次元ビジュアル！装苑の表紙美し過ぎるし見た瞬間の後輩に「なんのアニメですか？！」って言われた😂
Finally this account uploaded yuzu's program...the waiting is over guys lmao
he looks like a king who rules the ice
"I can only imagine how big his fighting spirit was during this FS. He was most likely so nervous about the jumps, probably his ankle hurted, especially in the second half even he was on painkillers.. painkillers make you sleepy but he was perfectly concentrated..most of the jumps executed perfectly, very little prerotation, great take-offs and landings besides his two struggles. He must felt anxious after the two jumps just weren't going smooth, must have felt so many things at that moment. I think in that moment his fighting spirit was the greatest. Gritting his teeth, changing his next jump to a combination he hadn't tried in a long time because of the injury but still pulled it off greatly as he knew he needed this extra points..

His fighting spirit really amazes me!!!!

And then you can see all the pressure falling of after the last jump. His spirit high, his feelings exploding...for me the last 30 seconds of his FS are  one of the most emotional skating moments he ever had. That desperation, excitement, happiness, proudness and love for skating. You could feel all that especially in these 30 or so seconds..
That's why he's the greatest today. 6 quazs are fine, but this emotion, this artsy, this love for skating he expresses... it can't be compared to the other skaters...

Yuzuru Hanyu, you're more than a legendary skater, you're ar role model, an inspiration and a truly amazing person! You've worked so hard and I know you will work even harder. I'm looking forward to the future! Fighting!!!!"
"何処を切り取っても美しいパフォーマンス✨
ただただ見惚れる❤"
"7:54
Awww look at his coach jump in the background 🥺🥺♥️"
2:33 So no one's gonna talk about that cat walk
"Dude, I'm not even kidding, I cried watching this, and I don't even know who he is. I was just imagining how many times  he might have fallen training this, all the dedication putted into this, it's so amazing."
하뉴와 같은 시대에 살아 행복하다 .❤❤❤
"久々に見たけどやっぱり凄いなぁ…
感動する"
Yuzuru Hanyu is a presence that you can't take your eyes off when he's on ice. He is the King and the Legend.
"That moment (5:39) when Yuzuru Hanyu touched his injured foot... I just couldn't help but tear up. It didn't let him down and it really hang in there.

When it comes to him, sometimes I feel like words aren't enough. His skating speaks for itself. Incredible!!"
"昨日のフィギュアを見て  物足りず ここに戻ってきました
緩急のつけ方、見栄の切り方... すばらしいの一言。"
"I'm Korean, living near PyeongChang, and I can't understand why I saw this performance now..!!!! I could have actually seen his performance right there if only I was interested in Men's Figure Skating! God...This is sooooooo freakin' awesome!!! He is like a spirit of wind and ice, jumping out of Japanese animation. I love this performance so much..the music, the emotion, .. not to mention his speed and techniques. Now I understand why so many girls there are screaming even before he started his performance...I myself also became his fan."
"I absolutely love him. Despite have been shook by the earth, he didn't give up his dream. 
He's such a sweetheart. Love the program.
Kisses from India, Hanyu."
"Yuzuru is the GOAT, he shows us what is the Olympic Spirits,  he is totally a challenger, an artist!!!! Love and support Yuzuru forever!"
何回みても素晴らしい！何回でもみたくなる！ほんとに素晴らしい❤
"4 years on, there are new Fanyus coming here every day to see this great & beautiful performance. The music & choreo are spot on."
"This performance is so mesmerizing, I don't know how many times I've watched it."
He's amazing! His eyes looks so dangerous at 0:33.
"何度も観てるし結果も知ってるのに…バランス崩すとヒャ〜と声が出ます。１７〜１８シーズンも怪我でまともに練習が出来なかった🥲
プーさんシャワーまた観たいです🧸前々からプーさんはリンクに投げ込まれてましたが、プーさんシャワーと言われ始めたのは、１４年グランプリシリーズファイナル中国会場でしたね🤭
🧸プーさんは子ども達にも幸せを運びました✨🎁✨"
"This is the performance that made me a big fan of him, till then and till now I’ve never seen someone skating in so perfect synchronization with the music ,skating so AMAZING ON ICE!"
This is not only an act of figure skating. This is a masterpiece of an art. And Hanyu Yuzuru is the artist! This is perfect!
"Anime is fine, but there should be an international movie made on him"
久しぶりに見にきたら号泣してしまった。こんなに泣くとはおもわなかった。人を感動させる魂のショーケースだよ
"It's hard to accept the fact that he decided to retire, that we won't see him competing, that we won't feel the typical nerves before he steps on the ice but I'm happy that he wasn't sad about this choice. that he will be free to show us a lot of things on the performances he decides to show us. thank you yuzuru hanyu for inspiring us on never giving up, to fight against every obstacle that comes into our lives, to keep improving. proud to say that I've followed the Greatest Of All Time in his highs and lows, so proud of saying that I've followed figure skating during the Yuzuru Hanyu era"
I think the reason he’s mesmerizing to watch is because he’s not just trying to score points. He’s telling us a story through his choice of music and artistry.
he did this INJURED
"The greatest skater, athlete, artist and human being that ever existed on this Earth.. There is no-one like him. We have been given a gift to be alive on this planet at the same time as Yuzuru Hanyu."
"This is the masterpiece no one will ever surpass. The performance, the composure, the elegance, the music, the rhythm and even the audience reaction are amazing. The finish was just simply stunning."
I still remember watching this performance back in 2018. 4 years later and it's still as magical as ever ...the emotions and artistry....
"He gives me what I call a ""Hanyu High"".  I experienced it in Helsinki when he won and then again here...but even bigger.  I watched this from the 3rd row in the arena and sometimes I still can't believe I witnessed this.  I feel so incredibly lucky and privileged to be able to see my my favorite skater of all time cement himself as an undisputed legend (the G.O.A.T. for me) and I've been watching this sport for almost 20 years.  He. Is. Special."
"東京ドーム単独アイスショーで最後にこの曲が流れた時の感動は忘れられません
東京フィルハーモニー交響楽団の生演奏も迫力あったし最初の「ドン！」でドーム内が揺れましたね"
"I'm not into figure skating but when I saw one of his performances while watching the news, I am amazed cause I can watch him skate from the beginning until the end, and now I just can't stop watching Yuzuru Hanyu's performances over and over again. I can feel his heart and soul in every performance. He is enchanting, mesmerizing and inspiring indeed. I became a fan in an instant.💖💖💖"
"I am so lucky to be born in an era same as Yuzu coz I've never been more inspired..... He inspires me every day to push myself harder and harder and never ever give up, whatsoever happens.... May God Bless You Yuzuru 😇😇😇😇♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️"
"The score was so high
And the ice was so blue
The best figure skater 
Is Yuzure Hanyu."
"100周年を迎えた国際スボーツプレス協会が1924年～2024年の100年間におけるベストアスリートを発表
6位は誰もが納得！この時の演技も唯一無二✨"
This performance is very sophisticating. He moves through the ice elegantly. This performance is definitely something that we should all remember.
its just amazing to watch him skate he looks so effortless all the time like he belongs on the ice
"He is amazing! The way he gets in character so you can totally picture a traditional Japanese magician - an excellent performance from Yuzuru Hanyu, as always.

Edit: Exorcist. That's the word I'm looking for. I know the Japanese word for it (onmyouji) but my brain was bleugh after watching this video. Thanks, @wx."
"フィギュアスケート史に革新をもたらした素晴らしい演技とプログラム
ここから6年経って更に結弦は驚くべき単独アイスショーを行っています
今の彼は必見"
The music is incredible 😭😭 I'm falling in love
wow he's beautiful
It’s one of my dreams to throw a stuffed Winnie the Pooh bear at Yuzuru Hanyu
"Just stopping by to remember my huge crush on Yuzuru when I was a kid. Honestly, nothing has changed, it still seems so beautiful, perfect, inspiring, like flying over ice, I love that feeling so much. I wish I could be like that too."
I get goosebumps at 4:25 every single time! His presence and performance quality is so strong
"I can't believe I've only just discovered Yuzuru Hanyu! As someone who hasn't paid much attention to figure skating in the past, I was absolutely blown away by his performances. His artistry on the ice is truly captivating, and his technical skills are nothing short of impressive. Watching him skate was an experience unlike any other - I found myself completely engrossed in every spin, jump, and gesture. It's amazing to think that someone can excel in a sport like figure skating to such an extraordinary level, and I can't wait to see more of what he has to offer."
He looks like flying. I cant stop watching. He is so cute.
That performance was breathtaking. He control the ice and the wind using her body. He was like naturally floats like a thin air.
"足痛いはずなのに、ジャンプ転ばず耐えてほんま凄い。
最後のコレオシークエンスで毎回泣く😭"
"Best youtube recommendation ever. I wish I had known Yuzuru earlier. Before watching this, I know nothing about figure skating and I have no interest. But, Yuzuru is so captivating. New fan here."
"One year ago, Yuzuru made history for Japan by becoming a two time Olympic champion for men's figure skating! What a great memory!"
このSEIMEIもスゴいけど、SPのバラード1番も至高の美しさと難度なんだぜ✨
Not only talented but also one of the hardest workers. Really proud to have someone like Hanyu represent Japan worldwide.
He is doing this with his heart. I can't take my eyes off him...he is real talent and really beautiful
"Sincerely thank you so much to the Olympic channel for upload this video fast enough after the games. Watched this so many times on TV, now it's easier to watch again and again on youtube, cannot wait for his short program video."
(テレビの前とは言え)これリアルタイムで見れたこと一生自慢する…もう何度見たか分からないけど毎回感動する
Judging from the current men’s field it looks like the next olympics will be about just quads and I’m afraid this will be the last olympic winning performance that actually combines art and sport.
"He's a gorgeous skater! Very well done, despite the oops."
4:35 that move and the synchronization with the music *chef's kiss*
"本当に今観ても泣けてくる。
まだファンとは言えなかったが、当時も感動して泣いてしまった。そして主人が凄いな、乗移ってるな！と！"
No one skates like him. There is truly no one like Yuzuru Hanyu.
Happy 1st Anniversary of this legendary performance and Yuzu becoming a Two-Time Olympic Champion!
"Yuzuru Hanyu’s star power and appeal is incredible… 19 million views and counting. At this point, ISU needs him more than he needs them lmao."
"Такой великолепный самурай,очень грациозный и статный парень.А какой трудяга.Характер на лицо.Обожаю❤"
"He's amazing!
Smooth, fluid...wonder what it would have been like if he hadn't been injured!"
Am I the only one who gets emotional while watching this performance? I could see how hard he trained for this. <3
Yuzuru brought me to the skating world
"凄いとしか言葉が出ない。
未来の偉人やで"
"there may be others who can beat yuzu in terms of scores and squeezing in as many jumps to please the isu but there will never be another person to surpass his artistry, elegance and the way he commands the rink. 

Figure skating flows within his body. His understanding of this art goes far beyond scoreboards and medals. When I watch him, it’s not the technical elements that keep me glued to my screen, but rather it’s his charisma and elegance that transcends. When he skates he feels every emotion and the audience in turn does too. I honestly do not understand how he can impact an audience to the extent he has.

 I think what he did at Beijing 2022 shows a lot about his character, striving for that 4A rather than purely doing a routine for the gold medal. I absolutely love it that he’s doing it in his own terms. He’s done more than enough for his fans so I really hope he continues skating for himself. I hope he recovers quickly so he can cleanly land that 4A 

He is in an indescribable and untouchable league of his own.  This is truly yuzu’s world and we all have the pleasure of witnessing it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
This is one of my favourite moments of 2018.
Not to be dramatic but my life is better thanks to him.
心打たれる演技、何度もここに戻ってしまう😊羽生結弦は最高です✨
"You can really see him smile when he saved that jump!!! :D

God!!! I am a grown man but I always cry when I see him perform his skate on the ice, please tell me WHY?!!"
Came in here for comfort after a failed exam in physics
Even his name sounds so cool.
Yuzuru Hanyu  is the *Best thing* that happened to Figure Skating
I do not understand how can someone dislike Yuzurus skating????
That was absolutely beautiful
"4:23 this moment was magical. The fact they he managed to not only recreate the same feelings here, he was somehow able to make it even grander 5yrs later. At a sold out Tokyo Dome. As an encore to a 3hr solo ice show. With PYROTECHNICS. Truly, there's no one like him"
ゆずる君の演技見てると何だか涙が、出て合掌しながら祈っています。頑張って下さい。❤
"He embodies Elegance , grace, and charisma with an abundance of skill and talent."
"The genius of figure skating and this opinion is shared by all fans of this sport in our country. Gorgeous, perfect."
"This is the new ""D-d-d-duel"" Cutscene. Right?"
音と一体化した動き、空中で回り始めるごまかしが無く正しい踏み切りのジャンプ、ただ滑るだけの瞬間がほとんどない。全てが美しく異次元で素晴らしい。ド素人でも「フィギュア分からないけどこの人だけは他と全然違う」とみんなが口々に言う。今の競技会も好きだが、やはり羽生結弦がいなくなった競技会場は寂しい。
A truly deserved GOLD medal💕💕  Mama Orser and Pooh are so happy and proud of you
"28M views and counting…
Who comes back here to watch this magnificent performance???
I do."
I'm just happy that there are people here just discovering Yuzu this year and being mesmerized by his gracefulness
"羽生選手のこの演技をリアルタイムで観られたことは、一生の宝だね。
素晴らしかった。感動で震えた。"
There is simply nobody greater. Nathan skates with excellent precision but Yuzuru skates with soul and it is the most beautiful form of art I’ve ever seen.
3 years and I still come here monthly it's the best performance I've ever seen 😭💜
4:24 this is what pure excitement and passion looks like huh WHAT AN ABSOLUTE KING
The Greatest Figure Skater of All Time ❤👑🇯🇵
"I don't know anything about ice skating, not even like it at all.  I was recommended by YouTube and watched Hanyu skating and I am hooked.  I also watch Nathan Chan to compare the two.  Nathan is great but I got bored half way and turn the YouTube back to Hanyu before Nathan finished his program. I can watch Hanyu again and again many hours and many days and still enjoying it very much.  Sometimes I watched his interview, I don't understand one word he is talking about but I can watch his facial expression for the entire interview.  He is magic to capture people's heart."
"""Winning doesn't always mean being first. Winning means you're doing better than you've ever done before."" he will always be winner for us."
"I don't know what's wrong with, I cried after watching this...maybe i read too much in between the lines of smth...but this performance shook me to the core"
久しぶりに見ましたが、この演技を見ていたら涙が出てきてしまいました。羽生くんの演技には人の心を動かすものがあるなと改めて思いました。今なお新しい世界をどんどん開拓し続けている彼の今後が楽しみです。リアルタイムで応援できる環境にただただ感謝です。
How can a human being looks this beautiful?
"I found him on tiktok when he got injured...and i said he was fine and handsome especially his name sounds cool and soothing, I searched him up and found out that he is a two-time Olympic champion, a two-time World champion, a four-time Grand Prix Final champion, a Four Continents champion, the 2010 World Junior champion, the 2009–10 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and a four-time Japanese national champion"
"A real out of class, in Beijing he didn't need any medals, and the medal he needs. This one from Yuzuru is just one of many times that he has made his way to victory with his symphonies, his technique, his extreme grace and above all beauty.  Yuzuru is already in history. From Italy! 🖤🤟🏻"
2018年平昌オリンピックから6年経っても動画再生数は留まらず、3700万回越えましたね。羽生選手の演技は何年経っても胸を熱くする、感動する。
"Bewitched! He is mesmerizing. No matter how many times you watch his programs you are dragged into his feelings, his movements, his gestures that match the music like no on else does. That's why after seeing all those programs since he was younger until now, we identify him with the music, the art and the stories behind each one. And this means that he is really the GOAT...,  much, much better than others that could have more difficult jumps but don't have the feeling of the music and the ability to show the story behind the music."
I don't even know anything about figure skating. Then here's this man who instantly made me a fan just by watching this. I literally didn't stop searching his other perfs after watching this.
this is so beautiful i’m in actual tears watching. what a talented person!!
オリンピック直前の１１月に右足首靭帯損傷して４回転が再びを跳べるようになったのが１月半ば。痛み止めを打って臨んだ大舞台でこの演技。フィギュアスケート競技個人戦の開始が１週間早かったら間に合わなかった。よく間に合った。頑張った。
"He is the greatest skater of all time, challenging what was considered to be humanly impossible, with the weight of the world on his shoulder he was practicing everyday, alone, betting his LIFE on it and he finally certified it yesterday on an injured ankle, first quad axel in history is now written in his name, he continues to push this sport forward every time, at this point he's above every gold medal, above every title, Yuzuru Hanyu is a phenomenon, he dominates this sport until the day the ice witnesses another Yuzuru Hanyu, and that won't happen in the next 100 years."
"引退しないで欲しい
せめて本人が納得いくまでは続けて欲しい"
He is the best ever :) It is such a roller coaster to be Yuzu's fan but it is absolutely worth. Such an inspiring athlete and person. I feel very privileged to be able to follow him so many seasons.
いまだに覚えていますいつまでも僕のヒーローです
"in my heart, there will never be another skater as moving and as talented as yuzuru."
This video made me fan of Yuzuru Hanyu. My history is full of his all videos. This is the best recommendation I have ever got from YouTube!
"I just figured out that he was injured before this performance, and let me just say... WOW. I’m seriously impressed. Congrats Yuzuru for pushing through, AND winning Gold!"
몇번을 봐도 감동이에요❤ 하뉴 유즈루는 최고의 스케이터입니다.
"4:20 It is beautiful the way Yuzuru lives every second of his presentation, it was art what he did, one as a spectator can feel the passion and dedication of Yuzuru and that moved me"
He is not just skating he is feeling each and every melody.....🤍
"Yuzuru you are simply a magician!! This performance was so beautiful, even with the couple of mistakes in the second half as your ankle and muscles started to feel the strain, given your very limited time to heal and practice before the Olympics (that first half was just perfect - those opening 2 quads looked sooooo easy!! +3GOEs!) It's my favourite SEIMEI ever, I love FightingOlympicYuzu!! And Chopin was exquisite! You deserve this so much after the achievements of the last 4 years, so happy you are the Reigning Olympic Champion AGAIN!!!"
"定期的に観にきてしまいます😅
やっぱり、このプログラムは伝説です。

羽生さん&SEIMEIを超える選手、プログラムはないな😅"
"I just randomly searched ""male figure skating"" and this came up, i don't even know who he is but it took me one video to become a fan, there's something about him, the way he moves so elegantly, you can tell he's really passionate about what he does, i see pure art ♥️"
YUZURU HANYU  IS  AND WILL BE THE  GOAT FOR  EVER.
king does it again
The best Figure Skater Hanyu!
Best skater in history.
"To be honest, I hope that Yuzuru Hanyu ends up getting that 4A and doesn't have to go to the Olympics. The whole sport is practically against him and it hurts to see. If he does end up going to the Olympics, I hope he'll go to 4CC after because then, he can win and get another super slam. Anyways wishing that October is a good month for Yuzuru! Let's pray that he get's that 4A cause he's already won everything so what else can he do LOL"
"5:14 One of the most satisfying things I've seen in my life

The shower of toys tho 😂😂"
"何年経っても改めて羽生結弦の技術力の凄さ、圧倒的な存在感に恐れ入ります
オリンピックのフィギュアスケートで、これまで有利とされてきた開催地での有名な楽曲や世界的なクラシック、オペラ、映画音楽を選ばず、この「SEIMEI」という極めて日本的な楽曲で真っ向勝負し、彼の突き詰めた表現力で己れの技術力と東洋的な美、歌舞伎の見得など伝統的な和の美学を世界に知らしめた素晴らしきアーティストでありアスリート
一本気で筋の通った生き方を本当に尊敬している。
日本人として大切な何かを思い出させてくれる。一言で言えばかっこいい！"
"There are many gold medalists, but there is only one Yuzuru Hanyu"
"I’m not really into figure skating. But this came on my recommended videos, so I took a look. 

I have been seduced and now I am hooked on to this guy. 🖤"
"he has talent? no. 
he IS the talent"
still feel the excitement of this great performance! Now I was so lucky enough to win the ticket lottery for all Repray ice story shows and I am lucky to win the ticket for Echoes of Life ice shows on last                        December 11  and the coming February 7. Yuzu are still performing beautiful programs. The legend goes on!! Love Yuzu for ever
This. Is. Figure. Skating.
"Юдзуру, настоящий фигурист! Ты такой сильный и красивый! Пойти на самый сложный прыжок и откатать так мужественно и воодушевленно - это дорогого стоит. У меня мурашки от твоих прокатов. Боже, как ты прекрасен Юзуру!
А судейство в очередной раз пробило дно своими грязными манипуляциями. Но честности в фигурном катании наверное уже и не будет никогда. Коррупция убила этот спорт."
"Jamás me cansaré de decir esto, Yuzuru es el rey del hielo. Hasta ahora el único que me transmite todo cuando le veo patinar. Hoy volvió a hacer historia."
"Hanyu Yuzuru, The Athlete who transcends the sport to an art, who can present beauty, meaning and the techniques at the same time. This is his life long dedication to the sport. He is undoubtedly the Legend. The legend which in not even the compliment but the FACT of who he is. 
This  is not yet to mention of how decent human  being he is......"
LITTLE POOH BEAR DID SO WELL
"0:31 me : aww look at his handsome n cute face
0:34 also me: i-  *dying of his duality*"
Beauty!
"うまいスケーターはいる。
基礎点の高い４回転を何本も跳ぶ選手もいる。
でも、これほど高いレベルで全てのエレメンツを完璧に融合させ
圧倒的に感動的な演技ができるスケーターは今も彼の他に誰もいない。"
Hoping and praying that he will get another gold this 2022 winter olympics 💚❤🧡
Arriba Yuzuru lo hiciste espectacular hoy en las olimpiadas no pudiste llevarte un premio pero si todo la admiración que tenemos en ti ❤
"5:21
When he opened his mouth, there were screams from the background, so it looked like he was screaming.😂😂😂"
I never get tired of watching this Yuzuru program. Seimei is simply my favorite!! ❤
I threw a Winnie The Pooh plushie there..it was awesoooome!!
"baby pooh did amazing , love him 💜🍯"
I am here to see how may people are here because of Google rewind. Please convert yourself to fanyu thanks :)
"This is, not to be dramatic, the peak of what I think skating has always been intended to be: jumps and amazing feats gracefully seamlessly integrated into a single fluid and attention claiming motion. Amazing. Yuzuru will always be the GOAT."
one watch a day keeps the doc away
Google Search on 2019 brought me here
"Yuzuru: Did a lot of cool tricks
Me who can't even skate properly on ice: ;w;"
"Легенда, талант, гений Фигурного катания, Юдзуру Ханью❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍"
Ice King

"I love the fact that, you don't hear voice overs during this. I LUV this, he was very outstanding! BEAUTIFUL"

フィギュアスケートを改革し続けるGOAT!
Comes back here from time to time when life seems so overwhelming.
It’s giving “Ice prince” but it’s really “king of the ice!”❤

"This performance was so incredibly... him.  So masculine, and so very Japanese.  There was passion in that choreography.  And the way he skated it, just masculine grace and elegance."

進化し続ける今も
彼はこのプログラムをとても大切にしている。
私も時々ここに見に来てしまう。
本当に素晴らしい時間を残してくれて ありがとうございます❗"
"Even after 6 years have passed, this performance still gives me chills. Truly, an all round athlete & skater, like no other. No one else will ever be able to skate the way Hanyu-san does. Such a unique skater. Others will come and go, but the one like Hanyu-san will not be seen again. Will continue to watch this and all Hanyu-san Olympic performances, because his dedication to this sport, his mastery and aura he has on ice, will always represent the true legacy of figure skating as it should be. Looking forward to more of his skating as a professional athlete as well.💜💙🤍"
"Yuzuru My Beloved, your performances never dissapoint <3"
"3,890万回再生おめでとうございます。大好きな羽生結弦選手の演技は何十回観ても感動します。プロアスリートになられて単独公演のアンコールで舞って下さる時、この五輪の感動を必ず思い出します。何年経っても色褪せない最高のSEIMEI 。"

スケートのことなんて何も分からない素人だけど、羽生くんが本当に美しくて、6年前から何度も見に来てしまう！オリンピックが始まると学校でみんな羽生くんの話ばっかりしていたあの時期に戻りたい。この陰陽師のおかげでスケートが好きになって、ディズニーオンアイスとかも見に行くようになりました。今までもこれからも唯一無二のスケーター！
"衣装も音楽も振り付けも何もかもがマッチしていて、本当に素晴らしい構成
曲の緩急、音を生かした振り付けでこれが見たかった！！っていう演技だった"

Well done."

Esse rapaz é o melhor patinador dos tempos mesmo sofrendo um acidente mostrou sua capacidade perseverança isso tudo ao amor que ele tem à esse dom além de tudo é humilde e de uma educação invejável isso tudo fez se tornar o que é OURO!!! JAPÃO 🇯🇵
"この演技は2018年2月、今は2024年8月、パリオリンピック期間中。

"まさにレジェンド✨
こんな選手2度と出てこないだろうな✨
羽生さんと同じ時代に生きれてとてつもなく幸せ💕"
"今現在、こんなにドラマチックな演技をする選手はいないと思います。

正しい技術・芸術性を競技選手の頃から一切妥協しないプロ意識が、今、プロアスリートとして、まだまだ高みを目指す”羽生結弦”という芸術を私達は見る事が出来ている。

羽生結弦選手　ありがとう。ずっと応援しています。"
何度見てもこの日の興奮が蘇る…音を消しても曲が聴こえるようだ。羽生結弦選手は唯一無二の存在。
競技やパフォーマンスを見ているというより、神に舞をささげているのを目撃した気持になる
本当に素晴らしいのひとこと✨幾度となくこの演技に励まされてきました。いつもありがとうございます😊
だからホント、普段のふにゃふにゃな笑顔から想像出来ない演技開始時の絶対やってやるマンな表情が好き過ぎるんだって
Happy Birthday Yuzu❤🎉 as always comeback for this masterpiece😂
今見ても、あの時と同じ緊張感と感動。
いくら優れた選手でも新しい事に挑戦するのは中々難しいと思う。元ある技で挑んだ方がリスクは少ない訳だし。でもそんな中、安定ではなく挑戦を取った羽生選手は日本人として、本当に尊敬してます。素晴らしい演技をありがとう
I'm so excited for Yuzuru's next solo tour in December!
THE STEP SEQUENCE IS MARVELOUS

リアタイで見てすごく感動したの今でも覚えてる
"私が例え1千年生きていたとしても彼ほどのスケーターには会うことは決してない‼️
あの短いスケートの演技の中に彼の品格、エレガントさ、儚さ、強さ、
そして人柄、様々なものを見せてくれる‼️
羽生君が愛されるのは
当たり前ですよ‼️
これを見ればわかるでしょう‼️
決して真似は出来ませんよ‼️
形だけ真似したって無理ですよ‼️"
I’m not sure why but this is probably my favorite free skate
"I had a dream about him last night, that's prove how much he's in my mind. You just can not forget about someone like him"
"Magnificient, the recovery is outstanding very professional. The twist and turns, and the landings made my heart raise."
It’s been years since I’ve seen this performance and EVERY time I see it i get shivers….he was truly born to perform! He is the greatest!❤
"Aún me resulta irreal que pude verle patinar la secuencia final en el Tokyo Dome  en febrero del año pasado. GIFT es realmente un regalo. 

Gracias Yuzu por seguir maravillándonos como patinador profesional! 💖"
"2024年でも高評価が 81万↗82万に増え、
7月になって ↗83万になってますね❣❣❣
これからも沢山の人に観てほしい。
演技も誠実な人柄も素晴らしいです。"
"Always watch and always best, our GOAT YUZURU HANYU"

He's a magnificent athlete with incomparably beautiful & extraordinary skating skills!!
There are tears in my eyes😢 so phenomenal!!
"Yuzuru, you’re a perfect artist.❤"
フィギュアスケートで1回跳ぶ事にこんなに会場が湧くのは他に見た事が無い
"Everyone would have loved to see him perform forever.
The acting, the music, the looks, everything is amazing.The pride of Japan🎌"
most powerful performance
I've loved skating for a long time but hanyu just amazed me like idk how to describe but it's just incredible and he is like a living legend for me
風格と気品❗絶対王者❗似たような演技しない‼️連覇されてメダリストとして復興支援を続けてます。金メダルこそ彼方にふさわしい‼️
The best ever. There will never be anyone else like Hanyu.
My most favourite skating performance ever
"He was Seimei the whole performance except for the choreo where he switched back to himself, Yuzuru Hanyu the GOAT."
何度見ても鳥肌が立つ、彼は見るもの魅了する華麗な演技🎭
하뉴는 신이다 …. 몸이 진짜 이쁘다
結果がわかってる今見るとこの緊張感はこのプログラムの意味合いにも相応しいしそれがめっちゃ楽しい
いつ見ても素晴らしい✨
やはり、羽生結弦選手のスケーティング⛸は特別です！
After 6 year still can give people goosbump.  Best skater in history!
今見ても涙が出てくる
yuzuru hanyu is so beautiful when he competes omg. I think ice skaters are the closest things I will ever see to angels in real life - they're so graceful and perfectly controlled while being artistic!
"Llevo años viendo esto y cada que lo veo me meo de la emoción como la primera vez no puede ser, es arte."
Omg that's the best performance I have seen till this date just how could a human be so perfect just how hard has he trained? Honestly it scares me
"He is the GOAT of figure skating, no one can change my mind😌 still making histories"
"まぁ男だから泣きはしねぇけど、
魂が揺さぶられるくらい感動する。"
"Самый лучший прокат💗💗💗💗
Никто и не подозревал, что он тогда катался с травмой ноги😭💔
А те два последних прыжка....Выехать с них было практически невозможно, но он смог.. 
Он выиграл второе олимпийское золото сквозь боли, сквозь травмы💗💗💗💗💗💗
Это прокат навсегда останется лучшим прокатом в истории фигурного катани💗💗💗💗"
"本当に綺麗だな…
1年に1回はふとした時に見返したくなる"
"Sorry if I was sounding bitter, I love this guys humble sincerity and talent combined, it’s very rare❤"
"技の完成度とか技術とか高得点とか大事なことなんだけど、羽生君の表現力は唯一無二なんだなぁ。
技が綺麗に決まったとかも要素だけど、やっぱり目から離せない、釘付けになるって、それを上回る演技にあると思います。

素人如きだし比べてどうすんだって話だけど、最近他の選手の方々のスケートを見て思うのは、羽生君のような表現者がいないなと感じるところ。
確かに、アマの世界では技の完成度だったり、綺麗さだったりの得点で競っているからそうなんだけど、見ていて、ワッとならないのがちょっとばかり寂しいかな。

ただの素人が偉そうにごめんなさい…"
"メダリストっていう漫画読んでからスケート興味持ったんだけど、前と全然見方違ってくるな…
スケート選手ってすごい"
Forever the🐐. His new Ice story3 in less than 2 weeks. Can't wait 😊.
"I won lottery for Yuzuru's solo ice shows, Echoes of Life in Saitama next December. So excited! "
羽生結弦は唯一無二。実力も人気もこれ以上記憶に残るスケーターは現れない。
Watching Yuzuru Hanyu perform on ice brings me the chills every single time- his routines and the way he feels every layer of music is so positively overwhelming and it's such an inspiration!
Yuzuru Hanyu; sen muhteşemsin. Uzun ve sağlıklı bir hayat diliyorum sana👏👏👏
羽生結弦だけで3000万再生はすごい
I keep watching his programs because I miss him skating competitively but he will always be the best male skater out there !
上半年最大的惊喜是yuzuru，虽然已经2024了，但也不晚。看到这样的表演很幸福，yuzu也给了我超多的鼓励。
ひたすら美しい……
I remember watching him on TV... and wow i can't believe it's been 6 years already ^^
من امشب برای اولین بار تو و هنر زیبای تو رو دیدم. تو شگفت انگیز و طوفانی بودی و هستی. موفق باشی.
"❤❤❤⛸️⛸️🌟🌟🌟oh, my goodness, what an outstanding performance! He loves and truly lives his character!"
王子っていうか王なんよな
5:51 The best performance I've seen in my life. Simply Yuzuru Haniw.
次の単独ショーが待ちきれない！
平昌オリンピックから6年経った今でも再生回数は増え続け、全世界からのコメントで溢れています。羽生選手のSEIMEIは至高のプログラム、フィギュアスケートの至宝👑⛸️🥇
He created  masterpiece on ice
He is simply unforgettable
この時に羽生君が金メダルを獲得しましたが、冬季五輪では1000個目の金メダルだったそうですね。本来は違うはずでしたが、他の競技が悪天候で延期になった事で、たまたま羽生君が1000個目の金メダルになったと聞いて、羽生君は苦難もあり過ぎますが、結果的にいつも運も持ってるなと思いました。真面目で努力家で一生懸命で優しい青年が、今後も報われる人生でありますようにと願わずにはいられません
何度観ても感激涙まででてきます☺️最高のスケータ羽生結弦さん 😚動画あげてくださりとても幸せです🙏
"This program can always touch your soul, those drum beats😭"
하뉴는 레전드선수임
The most elegant skater

"What a music, what a performance, what a story !!!!"
December 2024 and still watching this masterpiece🤍
Amazingly beautiful work! So powerfully graceful like a wonderful spiritual warrior of Light! 🙏
Still here after all this time passed can’t get enough of it :)
"もうー最高ー‼️
決まってるじゃん‼️❤"
Congratulation to Hanyu-san for his 2nd year as a Professional Skater in which he brought Figure Skating to high peaks with his SOLO Ice Stories ‼️ kudos‼️

これを超える和プロが出てくるのだろうか…何度見ても心揺さぶられる…
"いつもケンカばかりの旦那が「うわぁ! ボーヤン君より点数が低いよー」
と冷静さが皆無な私に「ショート・ショートはトップだから」と落ち着かせてくれた
観客の皆さんが階段を駆け下りてプーさん達を飛ばしてくれたり歓喜してたり
今でも現地にいるかのような気持ちにさせてくれる
何度見ても羽生くんの渾身の【SEIMEI】は心を揺さぶる　
その姿と演技にかける気迫は6年経った今でも変わらない　すごい人だ！"

スマホの小さい画面で見た練習での様子がいつもの元気がない感じだったので、どうしたのかな？と思っていました。
お怪我をされたと知り、血の気がひきましたが、メンシプのお知らせを見てやっと気持ちが落ち着きました。
少しでも安静にして休んでいなければならないのに、ご自身の声と言葉と画像で状況をお知らせくださり、本当にありがとうございますm(_ _)m

私たちファンはいつでも、ヒヤヒヤしたりドキドキしたりハラハラしたりワクワクしたりウキウキしたり、喜んだり心配したり緊張したりしながら、羽生さんが作る道をたどり、共に前へと進んでいける幸せを感じています。
こういう時の言葉はほんとに無力で、思うことの半分も伝えられてなくてもどかしいけれど、それでも応援の力として届きますように。

I stopped watching Figure Skating after he retired. Yuna Kim and Mao Asada were the reason I stuck with Ladies Single and Yuzuru Hanyu was the only reason I stuck with Men's single. None of the newer skaters interest me especially when it comes to Artistry and Technical skills.
This gold medal is nothing with reference to what he has performed 🙌 Yuzuru Hanyu .. hat's off 🙏

I rather the audience clap after the performance than keep clapping after he jumped. It's annoying because he probably might miss a beat.

I can do this too
I don’t get it he looked like he F’d up two different landings. How is this a gold?
"there leaves alot to grow in rhythm, he was hardly on beat, becoming somewhat like a circus act cheering for quads like acrobats"

"Ой. А я и не знала что Юдзурик так хреново откатал эту программу. Впервые только сейчас посмотрела. По всеобщим восторженным воплям казалось что и программа гениальна и исполнена гениально. Если к медали в сочи есть вопросы, то к медали в пхенчхане до сегодняшнего дня их не было. Шома Уно произвольную по крайней мере откатал гораздо лучше Ханю, хоть и было падение. Помидоры в меня не кидайте, это всего лишь мое мнение."
