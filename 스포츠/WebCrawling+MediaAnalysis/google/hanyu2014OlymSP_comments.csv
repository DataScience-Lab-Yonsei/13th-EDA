I've never seen a man fall that beautifully
"my heart aches every time he falls, such a cutie"
👏FIGURE SKATING IS MORE THAN JUST JUMPS PEOPLE👏
"Now after 4 years, he got revenge and won the second Olympic title with a clean program (no falls). Not to mention, winning while he is on PAINKILLERS."
"For people who wonder why 2014 Olympic men's free skate was a splatfest (compared to previous Olympics):
1. Long program/free skate was held one day after the short program. In previous Olympics, there was a 1-day break between the 2 programs, allowing the skater to have more time to rest and recover from fatigue.
2. This was the first time the figure skating team event was held. Having to compete in both team and individual events make it harder for skaters to maintain their peak.
3. The ice condition was not ideal. Short track event was held on the same day before the free skate. There was not sufficient time to bring the ice temperature down.
There you have it."
And he got a second gold what a legend
nothing's funnier than rooting hard for someone even though you know the event is long over XD
"This just proves that gold medalists also make mistakes, since they are just human. Pure determination is the key to success"
"This really wasn't a bad skate. His only errors were falling on the 4S that was fully rotated, and messing up the triple flip, which isn't worth many points anyway. He still landed another quad and 2 triple axels. Clear winner."
"People throwing bullshit at him just bc he fell make me want to push them into the ice and watch them do better, and you know what? They won't do better, because this couldn't be better, at least not from anyone's hands other than Yuzuru's. This was beautiful, powerful, emotional, artistic in so many ways, and if it wasn't for the nervous he probably would have done it perfect, without falling or having any difficulties. And btw, the other skaters were not at Yuzuru's level at all."
"Yuzuru at 19 years old: *winning  gold medals
Me at 19: Mom what's for dinner?"
"In Pyeong Chang Olympics 2018, he has redeemed himself from the free skate in Sochi. He has repeatedly expressed his regret for the mistakes in his free skate in Sochi, and that was what made him work so hard after Sochi. Finally, he has become the first person to win back-to-back Olympic gold in 66 years!!!! He is definiteyl the Greatest Of All Time."
Happy 10th anniversary of Yuzu's first Olympic gold medal! What a legend!
"10 years ago: Olympic Champion ❤️🥇
So proud of you, Yuzu!"
"He's a human, a beautiful human. He makes mistakes, beautiful mistakes."
since I saw him the first time I got obsessed with his ice skating 😍
"I don't think I've ever actually said this about someone, but he's absolutely beautiful. His movements and expressions are amazing."
"A unique, graceful, unearthly boy, Yuzuru Hanyu is a miracle.💖💖💖"
"Hey y'all let's appreciate yuzuru hanyu for his fantastic skating, and not bc he makes you think of yuri on ice, like yeah I like that show, but hanyu is a real person and real skater and real feelings and he works so hard and we should applaud him for that bc he's fantastic!! and pure !!! and talented !! and gorgeous !!! and amazing !!"
"Each time he stumbles or falls, the commentators pounce on his mistakes... but for us ordinary folks, it is his heart and soul that he poured into his performance, taking us on a journey of dramatic emotional waves. .. telling a love story. We care not for the points or technicalities; only the beautiful and meaningful rendition of the story. Only Hanyu could do that. ❣"
"He is the best figure skater I have ever seen, whether it is performance or technique"
even his falls are beautiful
"For all the people upset about people only being here because of Yuri on Ice. I would never have been interested in competitive ice skating if it weren't for that show. I would have never seen Yuzuru Hanyu's beautiful performance here. Yuzuru is a person and not a character, and I am so in love with his performance. I am glad that I was introduced to him and all competitive ice skating no matter what the channel of introduction was!"
"Yo, the ending pose will forever be legendary"
HE. IS. 19.AND.STILL.WON.GOLD.MEDAL. BLESS HIM
that outfit is beautiful woah
他跌倒的那会我只是在心里想着他的身体该多疼，心又有多难过，不过羽生结弦你永远是最棒的！！！
can i just say that his costume looks so beautiful on him
he is absolutely beautiful his outfit is perfect too .
"Commentator - A year ago nobody was expected that he could be possible gold medalist, but that's the position he is now...And now he is a two time Olympic champion, two time world champion, has multiple WR and he is loved by millions! That's a reminder that Yuzuru has never been a cyborg or an alien, he is just a human and he earned everything he has with really hard work and determination - all his medals and records, he is not perfect, he has made mistakes and his path was never easy but he has made himself a legend of figure skating! And he always will be legendary!"
He's so cute
"Foarte frumos programul lui Yuzuru, merită medalia de aur, ești cel mai bun!❤"
"I'm watching this again when Yuzu is 27, and the differences in skill and techniques between then, when he was 19, and now is remarkable. I am also reminded of how much skating has changed and grown in those years, and a lot, if not most of that, is due to Yuzu's influence. He keeps reminding us what figure skating really is, and it's far more than quad jumps."
"He's beautiful, a fairy tale prince, a magical performance a dream👏👏"
"My sole reason for following figure skating: Yuzuru Hanyu

His performances are mesmerising"
"That costume and program are Romeo and Juliet!
His combos and entrances boggle my mind!
Hanyu NEVER stops, always tries hard.
Heart of a champion!❤❤🎉"
"I can't even stand up in skates without falling over. Yuzuru Hanyu is amazing! You have to repect his incredible talent and skill especially since he is so young. By far, my favourite skater :)"
everytime he falls or messes up my heart breaks
"This performance played a crucial role in Yuzuru’s dominance for the following seasons. If you watch his interviews since he was a kid, he always said he wanted to win his first Olympic at 19 years old and then the one after that. Maybe if he hadn’t been disappointed with this performance (no one is a harsher critic than Yuzuru himself) he wouldn’t have come guns blazing the following seasons, breaking world records left and right, and bringing all the innovations and beauty he brought to the sport, that eventually led him to be crowned double Olympic champion in 2018. What an incredible athlete! His spirit is so much bigger than his body."
Wow. His skills are amazing; just like a beautiful swan.
I love the little jumps. Looks like gravity doesn't exist for him in a span of a second.
He always has the best music
"I am 19 years old...
What have I been doing all of my life ?  😭💔"
He still won gold. He is only human. GOAT forsure
Who's here NOT because of Yuri on Ice??
"What??!19?!!and the greatest of all time.
Only Yuzuru can relate....!"
"БРАВО ЮДЗУРО,БРАВО,ТИ НАЙКРАЩИЙ,НАЙТАЛАНОВИТІШИЙ,ТИ ЧЕМПІОН ВСЕЛЕННОЇ!!!!!!❤❤❤"
"In Yuri on Ice, skating seems a lil bit easy because everything is in animation, even those jumps etc. But after watching this, i feel like i won't even stand still for 5 minutes without slipping or falling. Skating is a serious deal"
"he is quite a heart throb in japan since this.
he was in my Japanese magazines"
But he still won.  What a star.  The GOAT.  Love him.
I am also a skater and Yuzuru Hanyu is my favorite skater. He is the champion not because he always wins but because he never gives up. He is a challenger. He always does his best. He is an inspiration. He skates so beautifully.. like a poem..❤⛸
"It’s a testament to a skater’s determination and heart that they can: 

1. Fall on opening jump
2. Stumble and put a hand down on a triple flip
3. Go on to skate a beautiful LP to Romeo and Juliet.
4. End up on the Olympic podium.

But enough talk about Sasha Cohen. Beautiful skate by Yuzu here."
"волшебный...
даже не взяв золото в 2022 году и сделав ошибку, он остаётся для меня лучшим спортсменом!! ❤️‍🩹"
Even after so many mistakes he still wins the gold which goes to show how ahead he was of everyone.
"Yuzuru is beautiful. He skates like an angel. 
Who cares if he falls. His overall performance is beautiful."
What i love from hanyu is not because he did alot of quads. But how he dance into the music. So beautiful
"People asking how he won gold with this performance seem to forget that he got  had a WORLD RECORD BREAKING short program score that was over 100. He deserved gold simply for that, honestly. That score added to this score made him win gold. People who know nothing about figure skating or people who didn't watch 8 hours of Olympic men's figure skating live to see every single performance on those two days really shouldn't be questioning a world renowned figure skater like Yuzuru Hanyu. Skating is the kind of sport that takes many elements into consideration for the final score, and that's why Yuzuru Hanyu won, because he had the best score once all those elements were added in. "
He's so amazing and cute...goshh I miss him
Look at here and you can see how much he has improved from here to 2015 when he broke the records in 2015.
he was performing while injured and on pain-killers.  Can you imagine if he was 100% healthy?  He would have scored by miles ahead of everyone else! only the untrained eye cannot appreciate the beauty and art of what Yuzuru does on ice.
Proud of all Yuzu performance...He's  a Legend the best figure skating ever
"Even he falls many times, he just smiles sweetly, love him❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
Wow he's so young and talented!!
"Yes I did come from a Yuri on Ice video but anime was not on my mind while watching this magnificent performance. Yuzuru was fantastic!! I'm so glad he got gold, he completely deserved it. :)"
Saw his performance in Pyeongchang Olympic and begin to search his videos. Ooh you just made me fall in love with Japan 😆 Wish you another gold in 2022 Olympic
"man this guy's amazing, coming back right after those falls. he just gets up, and goes back out and does his best. he's such an inspiration :') i don't even skate, but still. (ok also am I the only one in love with his outfit)"
"Negative comments about Yuzuru are so ridiculous, especially now, after NHK Trophy and GPF xD
Haters can say everyting they want about him,  but anyway he DESERVED to be the Olympic Champion, and this season he fully proved it. Hope he'll go to the next Olympics and will become twice Olympic Champion x)"
"Милый  Ханю, как ты  тонко чувствуешь музыку, как пластичны твои движения, как ты профессионален!!!Успехов тебе по жизни, здоровья!!!"
"羽生くん、フィギュアスケート、アジア、日本人男子で初の金メダル🥇おめでとうございます🥇
当時は羽生結弦選手のこと知らなくて、後から知って感動しました🥹"
"I've always loved figure skating.  I don't get why they make such a big deal over jumps, to me the spins that have them folding up like a flower blood and blooming out is gorgeous."
"過去１００年のベスとアスリート　６位に羽生選手選出され、おめでとうございます💖

"I honestly love this performance, because it shows that these people are human to, and they make mistakes. Everyone make mistakes, it's the way you recover from those mistakes that really matters."
He still did amazing❤️❤️👏👏 and his body looks stunning
People act like he can't make a mistake every now and then! Great champions ALWAYS make mistakes at one time or another - there's no such thing as absolute perfection ALL THE TIME! Some fans are so ignorant. I adore Hanyu but I give him space to make errors. He is still THE BEST!!
"This man never brings his performance off the ice he leaves everything there and when hes on the ice he controls everything, Yuzuru hanyu is truly amazing."
"Yuzuru is incredible, he makes it look so easy, he just sorta soars across the ice."
"２０１４．２．１４
９年前の今日
金メダルに輝いた日✨🥇✨
おめでとうございます✨🎉✨
あれからずっと深化し続け、すばらしい舞いを見せ続けてくださり、ありがとうございます。"
"To be honest 
His performance feels vary dramatic and that's what makes him different and I love that about him
And his form is just gorgeous 
And so is he 😁😁"
"Oh my god. I was trying to drown out the commentators’ voices when I recognise “What is a Youth” from the 1968’s Romeo and Juliet at 3:08. And now I’m crying. 4:32 gave me goosebumps and I started crying uncontrollably. Then I realised Yuzuru was imitating Juliet stabbing herself at 4:43. This performance brought tears to my eyes, all the more so when I’m a big fan of that movie."
"Like the competitive Star that he is - he knew it wasn't his best. So he came back stronger, more detail crisp, more graceful  just breathtaking to watch!  🌟✨❤"
It's even prettier in real life than in anime lol
He's so beautiful!!!! What kind of magic does he use?? I am in love with him!!
His expression at Kiss & Cry explains why he was so shocked when he heard he won
"Как жаль, что мы больше не будем его видеть мировое катание. Непревзайденный!!! Уникальный!!!"
本当に美しすぎて同じ時代に生まれることが出来てこんなに幸せなことはない
"*yuzuru hanyu; king of the rink, the little ice prince, history maker and record breaker*"
いつ見ても美しい！この後まだまだ伸びる才能と努力が本当に凄い。ロシアとウクライナ東部と南部が平和になりますように。会場の壁の模様も綺麗だなあ！
"I'm so proud of you. You didn't skate the best that night (it was far from your personal best), but you fought till the end and earned the medal. That is the spirit of a true champion. Only 19 years old, still a child at heart, but look how far you've came! Thank you for the amazing SP that is a world record, thank you for your hard work, your bright smile and all the inspiration. Please keep believing in yourself, we will walk together the next four years!"
He is a miracle that has landed on the ice.
I stumbled upon ice skating because I had a memory of my father taking me skating. The complexity of his moves and how he just swiftly gets back up after falling those first times is just making me tear up!🫶🫶🫶
"He deserved his gold!!  Quit the bad mouthing, people!  To come back like that after two falls and keep on fighting is so difficult  under that kind of pressure... It was a beautifully constructed program as well which truly showed his courage!  "
"There will always a gold medalist, no matter how many falls there are in a match."
"I enjoy seeing the power and energy male figure skaters bring to the ice, but I don’t often see them as graceful. But Hanyu’s style is ridiculously elegant, it’s like his feet aren’t even touching the ground. It’s amazing how he just glides; he’s one of the most graceful figure skaters I’ve ever seen."
"Okay, there are TOO MANY comments about Yuri!!! on ice here. I love the anime, but pls, there is an extent of how far one should go. Hanyu is an amzing skater, he should b recognized for his performance, if u came bcs of Yuri, fine. but u dont have to say it, just enjoy his performance. ALSO Yuri from yuri on ice was NOT, I repeat NOT BASED on Yuzuru Hanyu. The creators have said it is based on Tatsuki Machida an other Japanese figure skater, the writer of the anime was his fan. So pls stop spreading the rumor of having it based on Hanyu, it is slightly disrespectful to the anime creators. The creator specifically made Yuri's experience vastly different from Hanyu's to not have it mistaken. So pls stop putting the two together."
Who else is here after he won gold for the second time? I needed to see this performance again. His beauty and skill evolves every second!
"Now is ,2022 and still love him❤️❤️"
that ending pose just made him and his performance 100x more hotter wow ok
Just announced his retirement today... he will always be a legend
His strength and the spinning is AMAZINGLY awesome 👏🏼
"Coming back to this after watching his gold-medal performance from last night, and I’m just filled with overwhelming pride for this phenom who skates with such passion and elegance. There’s a reason he won gold, and it’s his heart. Lovely, lovely performance"
This ina bauer makes me CRY and takes my breath away every freaking time I watch it
He is the best figure skater in my heart，forever！

結弦、今まで本当に頑張ってきたねありがとう😭これからも応援していきます結弦の人生に乾杯🌈
"What an amazingly talented and absolutely, stunningly beautiful man."
羽生结弦是最伟大的花样滑冰运动员。
"The fact, that he fall, but still kept on going and the end gave such a beautiful performance...just seeing a life lesson from him"
"If you want to see a clean (no falls) version of the same program, look up the 2014 world championships."
"I just miss him. Everything Yuzu does, everything he have done - World Records to Historical Records to Legacy - Thesis that could potentially change the future of this sport, his college major, him inspiring other Skaters and children - He indeed bet his entire life into Figure Skating. I have no any other words to describe how much he dedicated his life just to make this sport for 10 years all through out his Senior circuit. And now I can't imagine him challenging the formidable QUAD AXEL - another kind of monster he has to conquer. If he ever gonna land that in an official ISU competition, my oh my - another legacy that no other skaters could ever fathom to do so. He leads the way to the gateway of Quints and Quad Axel, this man is unbelievable."
"I've watched it for so many times and I already have lost count.🤗🤗😊😄😊
All I know is that I want to watch Yuzu perform his creative skating with finesse, fluid jumps, and nearly flawless technique. His skating is superb. One cannot match him in terms of creative execution, even if they score higher than him, no one can be like him. It's refreshing to watch his deft movements on the ice. Love him. 🥰🥰🥰"
"Self-noted my favorite moments 
3:25 the entry of this 3a2t combo is insane
4:30 this lay-back ina bauer is perfectly matched the music. One of his best ina bauers for sure
4:42 Juliet’s dagger gesture"
his program was so good that even falling he won the gold. incredible!!
"Zlatý chlapec, aký je nádherný a nádherne tancuje"
"Я счастлива что жила в одно время с этим великим артистом и спортсменом,.. ❤❤❤"
"I can't believe how talented, focused and cute he is"
Now after 8 years i am his new big fan 😘😘😘
He is like a fairy isnt it? So smoll and light. My beautiful GOAT ❤️
A true  Romeo❤ dancing on skating ⛸ on Ice
"В Сочи ему как-то тихо аплодировали. Те люди ещё не знали, что перед ними мировая легенда 😔"
今天我第一次回顾羽生结弦3次冬奥会的历程9个表演节目，感慨万千，他19岁即一举登上巅峰，创造亚洲男单历史，按照贯例他可以退役了，但他没有；平昌冬奥会他显示了王者风范，事隔66年再次创蝉联的纪录，他可以激流勇退了，但他没有，而是充满了诚意，不断奉献给世界更精彩的节目，堪称＂永载史册”的众多节目，尽管北京周期他的节目们的价值并没有在分数上体现出来，但仍大受欢迎；他又坚持到北京冬奥会，他在北京冬奥会的三个节目，蕴含的丰富哲学和价值观，对全世界观众而言，激励的意义远远超过金牌所能给予的范畴，他真正成为冰上的帝王，real GOAT！看到谷歌全球2022年度最受关注运动员，羽生结弦名列第6，而日本用雅虎搜索，中国用百度搜索，如果汇总，羽生结弦2022年总搜索量至少能列前三甚至第一位。
此の時・・まだ19歳！メダリストになった事で得たことも沢山あった思いますが、失われた事やご苦労も多々あった事でしょう。・・・私達ファンは貴方の健康と幸せな人生を願っています。
"Yuzu's performance is breathing, touching and inspiring! He is an excellent combination of strength and beauty."
"Получаю удовольствие от его катания. Он, такой легкий, такой пластичный. Вращения, просто, потрясающие. Прыжки, легкие, высокие."
羽生结弦的花滑永远如此迷人
"I think is actually quite poetic the fact that YOU CAN FALL AND STILL WIN THE GOLD. That's what life is about: Go for the gold, having a couple falls doesn't mean you won't get it. <3"
He’s literally so beautiful
"i actually didn't watch the sochi winter olympics back in 2014 and im totally regretting that aha :^) but besides that i love yuzuru sm, he's like an angel on ice"
"AMAZING,when it comes to Hanyu the only thing that comes to mind is  AMAZING"
It's 2024 & i'm watching
Did not expect the falls but truly amazing talent. Get goosebumps every time i watch his performances.
"Dearest Yuzuru, it really does not matter how many times u fall, its how you are going to stand up after the falls that matters.... <3 Moon <3"
"His flawless short program, which also broke the Olympic record, secured his win on this. Also , even if he fell here, he did really well on his other quads and jumps more than his other competitors did. That's why he won the gold here. His SP and FS is totaled together giving him high score to secure that gold."
The sport changed soo much. If he have been able to do what he did today it probably had broken a world record
Я в полном восторге несмотря ни на что!он гениален
The way he just glides so elegantly is amazing. It’s beautiful.
"He is so elegant, and beautiful, the way he moves, it hits me differently than other performers, I don't know why"
"ЮДЗУРУ МЕГА ЗІРКА,ЯКА ЗАТМИЛА УСИХ ФІГУРИСТІВ,ЯКІ  БУЛИ ЗА ВСЮ ІСТОРІЮ,БРАВО ХАНЮ,БРАВО,ТИ НАЙКРАЩИЙ!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
He's so graceful and lovely.. so beautiful
"His everything are so beautiful.
His body line
His movement
His outfit
Even his finger
Even though he make some mistake but I think that he maybe is just nervous and when the video reach half of it,  I can feel then yuzuru start to enjoy the skate. All of his body start to dance follow rhythm of the song. I start to fall for him"
いつ観ても何度観てもカッコいい!
Ma quanto è bello!
"Simply a beautiful performance. I also love the fact that even though he had a few falls, he kept going and was getting better and better unlike some other skaters who I know gets unnerved after a couple of mistakes. Great job Hanyu!"
Юдзуру это величайший фигурист!
"Not gonna lie, has really nice legs XD"
I thought he was great! He had a few stumbles but he was very elegant with his performance !  And he really is trying!!  Plus he's pretty good-looking in my opinion..  XD
"he's really amazing. he's like a poet on ice, i love watching him."
he's grown so much since the Olympics I can't wait to see his huge improvements at the next one. he was absolutely breathtaking at for the nhk trophy
"He deserves the gold medal! People who complain that he fell two jumps and say that he should not have win because of that... 
...seriously, that's not fair! A program consists of more than the  few jumps! His skating skills are admirable and he has a lot of high levels. So just shut up guys!!! Maybe that was not his best performance, but he was still better than the others... he is amazing!"
"And yet again, Yuzuru Hanyu is first in PyeongChang 2018 Olympics👏🏼 He deserves it."
Congrats for winning the gold medal! Very talented skater!
Legend.
"Having had connections to the skating world since I was 2 (now in my mid-twenties), I have seen how skaters have become less artistic and more reliant on jumps and points as the years have progressed. Only a few skaters still possess this raw, artistic talent. Hanyu is one of those people. Simply stunning"
That spin he did at 4:40 was pretty awesome. I'd never seen anything like that done before.
Гениальный мальчик!
"My heart is aching, Is this my love for yuzuru?"
it's been 2 years but every now and then I come back to watch his performances
So beautiful performance.. he is genius!
"It's 2020 now... 6 years later and I'm still in awe about how beautiful this was, exhausted, nervous and a 19 year old having to deal with the pressure of the whole world's eyes on you and yet he still did amazing beautiful. I don't understand how people could complain about him winning.. everything about this is a masterpiece and magnificent and I doubt they could do it better anyways. Those who appreciate Yuzuru Hanyu and is skating, appreciate art."
"I love that it was all like, c
Commentators: ooo, he didn't do so well
Him: wins gold

when he skates his body flows like water, it's so beautiful!"
Yuzuru is the best!So gracious and lovely to watch!He is a legend!He's making history already!I can't help but being impressed by how courageous he is!My respect for Yuzuru!He looks like a prince!God bless Yuzuru and Japan!
"So versatile, agile, charismatic. Amazing presence of mind when he falls. He is a genius, and we are lucky to be living in the same age."
너무 아름답고 멋있습니다~~
I cant even imagine his nerves in a competition like this.
Bello siempre bello❤❤❤ desde argentina
"When I started watchin Yuri on ice I was like *""Why does he fall so often? And why is he participating in contests when he still does a lot of mistakes?""*
Well now that I watched a few videos I get why it is 100 percent realistic😅"
Yuzuru is art himself. So beautiful
"Oh my, this is beautiful. Even his falls looked graceful."
4:30-5:20 gave me goosebumps. Really emotional and passionate. I hardly knew anything about figure skating but I love all of Yuzuru's performances.
"Why be so angry about a thing like anime, if it leads people to discovering such beautiful things. 'Being brought' from something isn't a bad thing. Why anyone isn't happy that something is presenting things they love in a good way, that people want to learn more about it?"
"The 2018 Olympic Champion,Yuzuru Hanyu again!"
YUZURU ERES PERFECTO COMO PATINADOR UN SER HUMANO ADORABLE BENDICIONES UN ABRAZO ENORME DE URUGUAY 🇯🇵🇺🇾👏👌👍🤗🌹❤️
"comments from 3 months ago: WoW much skate.. very performance.
comments now: everybody is here from Yuri on ice right?"
❤❤❤WANDERFUL AND CONGRATULATIONS 🎉
"Yuzuru was the best one and who would have won if not him?! He has speed, smoothness, passion, tghe jumps. Yes he fell but so did the others in the top as well. I have seen plenty of gold winners through the years who have skated awfully. Yuzuru was the winner. His sp was brilliant."
Most beautiful performance I've ever seen in my life. Literal tears👏😭❤
"7 years ago I fell in love with his grace and enormous skill, yuzuru fan forever 💓💓💓"
WOW WOW WOW . The king Of ICE
"Its been so long since the last time i watched Yuzuru skate. He inspired me to try figure skating unfortunately...our country only has two seasons and yeah...well pretty much gave up on that dream😂 Anyway, YUZURU I LOVE YOU (lol)"
i can say this again and again figure skating world will never witness a skater like hanyu again
His entry to the jumps was very creative. I usually can predict when a skater was going to do their jump because of their long 'loading time'.. But here I can't really predict when he was going to do his jumps. He was doing the steps or whatever they call it & then suddenly a jump. I love it..
Because of this performance now I hold my breath everytime he jumps 😭 keep it up my dear you are amazing
His skating has so much emotion I just cry whenever I watch him skate
How can a man be this beautiful? He is such pretty lad
he deserved the gold medal such a talented young boy..i liked more the SP performance
"Today he will be skating short program in 2021 world championship. I can not believe this was 7 years ago. Now he is the GOAT. Time really does fly. He became a legend, an idol. So proud of him."
十周年快乐！🎉🎉🎉⛸🪽
there are wayy too many YOI comments...i watch the anime too but there's no need to keep talking about yuri when its yuzuru performing
No energy during ThE pErFoRmNcE ??!!!?? There so so much energy and emotion the male speaker has no clue 😮
"Yuzuru est la grâce incarnée, une technique superbe, romantique il nous emporte dans l'ivresse de sa chorégraphie. ...un prodige !!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Not gonna lie- I started looking up men's ice skating after Yuri!!! on Ice came out haha
I'm watching this 6 years after this video has been posted and now I'm 19 years old (the same age as Yuzuru in this video) worrying WHYYY I didn't watch this BEAUTIFULLY TALENTED  MAN before!
"He is awesome , polite and ... Good-looking I would say lol"
"Thanks for uploading this! I'll forever remember Sochi 2014 because of Yuzuru-kun's greatness! Though his SP was the best for me too! That really made him nail the gold so I hope we can forever see it on Youtube too, please? Congrats again Yuzuru-kun! Can't wait to see how more your career will flourish! Go and beat your own score! You can do it! Can't wait how you'll fare in Pyeongchang 2018!"
He still alive in 2022. Super beautiful. 💙
"What a beautiful presentation, so aestethic and breathtaking, I love it, and the oufit is so pretty and shinny!"
Now a days fs is more like jumps or less artistry with music on ice.... I think only yuzu is there who still give priority to music vm which makes his program more attractive and beautiful than others skaters out there ....indeed legend 🙏🏻👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Came here again today after he missed a quadruple salchow in his short program at the Beijing Olympics. His short program world record might have been broken today but Yuzu remains a living legend in figure skating.
when his outfit shines brighter than your future
"Юдзуру Ханю, само волшебство! Гений, волшебник. Его скольжение просто сказка. Удачи тебе, дорогой. Поцелован богом."
"This was one of his most emotional performance, I really felt that intensity of emotion. That's a true winner, figure skatinh is not only about all that fancy, it's also about the story and emotipn brought out. He was like wind, flowing in the ice. Amazing 😍❄️❤️"
"Oh my god, so beautiful 
So inspiring 😍😍😍
I wish I can back to my childhood and learn figure skating 😂😂😂"
Yuzuru hanyu ❤❤❤❤
"彼のことは一言では表せない。
この時のパフォーマンスがあったからこその今、とも言えるが、このフリーは決して悪いものではない。本人は２つのジャンプの失敗でとても疲れたと言っていたが、４トゥループや３アクセル３トゥループは非常に美しいし、ルッツもとても軽やかで柔らかい。そして何と言っても冒頭の４サルコウ、成功率が低くとも、オリンピックという舞台で回避しなかったことは尊敬せざるを得ない。
今まで何度も驚くべきパフォーマンスを披露し、何度も我々の期待を上回り、そして３度目の五輪が近づいている今、このソチのフリーを鑑賞するのは非常に感慨深い。演技後、スコアを知った後の表情を含め、感慨深い。私にとって、ショートもフリーも忘れられない演技です。"
love you yuzu
Yuzuru is a legend
"Beautiful yuzuru hanyu
Fan from Indonesia 🇮🇩"
SO AMAZING I love how graceful he is when he messes up✊😫 great human and skater😌💜
"I came here b/c of yuri on ice, and I didnt know skating was this amazing, like someone had said before, Yuzuru Hanyu is an angel on ice."
"One of Yuzu vids came up on my recommended on my You Tube Page during lockdown last year late one night. I've been in love, awe and magically moved ever since.  I watch at least one performance every day. My Yuzu fix. Seeing him makes me happy."
Love the ending pose.
He gave himself tremendous pressure during Sochi Olympic. David Wilson in an interview told that Yuzuru mentioned that he insisted on this program as he wanted to win the Sochi Olympic.
this performance makes me feel emotions again
"okay can like all of you guys stop complaining about him not deserving gold because he fell and all this other crap that no one cares about? He deserved gold fair and square. He fell so what? EVERY SINGLE MALE IN THE TOP 10 FELL SO SHUT UP! He landed his other quad jump (i think it was a quad toe) perfectly which defiantly raised his score. His routine was much harder than the others, and was technically more difficult. He was amazing, graceful, and broke the world record for having the highest short program score in history! He did perfectly fine after falling twice and stumbling a little. Hanyu deserved this gold medal! "
I came here because my mom and dad were talking about this guy and i wanted to know what he did. Checked the comments and totally forgot about Yuri!!! on Ice oh my gosh
I love all of his programmes 😘😘
転倒が無かったかのような芸術性にあふれた演技に感動した
I really love his gracefulness
I fell in love with him when I saw him in a white shirt with blue lace embroidery in it (if I remember correctly ) in the thumbnail and then I watched the video and  I fell in love with him and his performance on a whole new level . All of his performance are so stunning and even when he makes a mistake he gets back up and perform so graciously again it's so beautiful . He's an absolute legend . I have been watching all of his videos
he's georgous
This is beautiful
"Even when he falls... It is beautiful !!!?? What a grace, I'm amazed !"
"Hey Olympics, hope you could also post Yuzuru's full short program performance. It's the world record score for shorts surpassing the 100 mark. That would shut all the haters up we have here. Thanks."
2:33 как же это красиво! а концовка какая!💔✨ до слез пробило..
The whole program is the process of people falling in love with Yuzuru Hanyu's skating
Why did I cry watching this
"Happy 7th anniversary to Yuzu's first Olympic gold medal! I remember that day well when he won the gold. I was so happy for him!
I have to say I disagree with the commentator, Chris Howarth, that pressure got to him here. The short program was on the day before, it ended late the evening and all the top skaters got to sleep late night. Then the next day, they had to wake up early for practice before the free skate so the schedule was really unfortunate and everyone made mistakes in the free skate. Yuzu's real forte was the strong second half of the program with 3A-3T, 3A-2T, 3Lo, 3Lz and the 3Lz-eu-3S (judges were really strict with him that the 3S got invalidated there and that they counted his 3F as a fall in the first half of the program too). Patrick had his chance but he couldn't grab the opportunity. Patrick made too many mistakes (on the 4T, 3A, even the 2A at the end of the program and he also doubled a planned 3S) and his second half of the program was a lot weaker than Yuzu's. Yuzu skated really well at his first Olympics, he skated two perfect short programs and with a free skate that was enough for the gold. Congrats Yuzu!"
Imagine how much more they fall during practice.. respect.
Poetry in motion.... Fluid gold.
"I'm glad anime has brought more popularity to the sport, but I agree with the other comments about watching Yuzuru's performance with respect. If Yuri on Ice brought you here, then that is great! However, if you want to start a whole conversation about how Yuri on Ice is similar to this, then please take that to a forum somewhere else. As a fan of figure skating and a fan of anime, it is rather embarrassing to witness these inappropriate comments."
You can see that his artistry had progressed very much in the past years .
You know Yuri on Ice is great ...but Yuzuru Hanyu it’s actually a real person ... not a drawing !
"I know everyone heard about Yuri!! on Ice, but I'd say that they capture ice skating well actually. I'm inspired enough to actually go try it when the ice gets frozen. It looks hard, but I'll give it a go! I'm just surprised that the falling in the anime actually happens to even professionals in real life. It kind of really opened my eyes to this sport. I'm very happy for Yuzuru Hanyu's performance, I think he's one of the best skaters out there."
He’s the only figure skater who can cast both Romeo & Juliet on ice and also the most beautiful men figure skater I’ve ever known
what a beautiful human being
"to people who says that he should not deserve gold: 
go to the protocol and watch the jumps he did carefully. he jumped two 3A combination in later half, and even the jumps he fail he rotated clearly:-)

BUT I LOVE P CHAN GO PATRICK GO"
Wow that is the most beautiful performance and costume I have ever seen! Breathtaking! Did he win gold here despite the falls?
"Ew @ all the weebs in the comments. This skater's name is Yuzuru Hanyu. He is not Yuuri Katsuki. He is an amazing skater and he should be treated and respected. Yuuri was inspired by him, but it's just downright disrespectful to leave a comment with something saying, ""Oh, look it's Yuuri! I mean Yuzuru!"" Please, please, PLEASE RESPECT YUZURU HANYU. HE DESERVES IT."
"you better take responsability because you made me a fan. a super crazy fan. i love how he skate, just love him. so much talent in just one person!!!"
Still a beautiful performance.   He's got the skill of speed and force and ofcourse  his artistic skills.  They way he captures the audience.  Full of heart
Can't wait for Yuri on Ice
GOAT❤
Yuzuru. You are really amazing. Please always remember that.
"I hate when people go like "" he fell, why he's got gold?""  Guys please.... jumps aren't everything!
Even if he fell, he always skates so good, he looks like he's flying through the ice"
He's awesome wow💗
Happy 7th birthday to Yuzuru's 1st OGM!
Самый лучший фигурист! Я буквально влюблена в его катание)))
I love and admire the japanese people... it´s always stunning how classy they are! What a talent!!!
"There's so much artistry in this performance, and his falls make it easier to see how much he cares about his performance. He is so brilliant."
"Wow this is SO majestic, I’m officially obsessed with figure skating 😱"
Ina Bauer ❤... full of thrills and chills! I hope to see Romeo and Juliet 2.0 again soon
Forever the gold medals' favorite <3
god he is so talented
Yuzuru Hanyu❤️❤️❤️
羽生くんのスケートが大好き、ソチのときからずっと応援しています🥰🥰
"He's gorgeous, adorable and pretty amazing!!! 😍👌❤"
"yuzu, you will always be the best"
"His second gold medals, amazing man. My only Romeo !!"
"This is beautiful but that 2 mistake is painful, thank god he manage to win gold
I'm nervous for this 2018 olympic, hope yuzuru kun will win gold again 🙏"
ショートの時とは、コントラストなメロディーに載って優雅に舞う姿は王者の風格が有りました。持病の喘息を克服して金メダルを獲得した姿に勇気を貰いました💖
no matter how many times I rewatch this I never got bored
"Please stop filling the comment section from Yuzuru with comments about yuuri on ice.... It's annoying. Please enjoy the beauty from yuzuru's performance and stop being so disrespectful toward him. Go and post your comments about yuuri in yuuri's videos, no here. Please."
4:30 send chills all over my body❤️ so beautiful
"🥰🥰what a joy to keep coming back to watch this performance, I just can't get enough.. Goodluck on your 3rd Olympic medal."
"Gotta admit I came here from Yuri On Ice. HOWEVER!  I need to say that I deeply respect this man. I was a dancer and I know how it feels to mess up a performance like that. He kept going and gave it his all in the end and that's hard to do. Basically, he is an incredible athlete and performer and I want to be his friend."
It’s been 10years…wow
"“ When Yuzuru is on his jumps is sensational when he’s off his falls is spectacular. “

- Tracy Wilson before she even coaches Yuzuru at 17 y/o"
"The men's individual event was weak because of lots of mistakes but the fact is that putting together the SP and the LP the best skater won. Hanyu had a fantastic short program but in the LP he opened the door for Chan, who failed to get his chance, so the best won the competition."
Please upload his SP. That performance made a world record. Everyone should see it. Pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaseeeee!
Yuzuru is a legend on the ice
"Short program was perfect. 
101．45"
"Guys, this is combined score of his short program and this free skating program, even tho he made few mistakes here, the short program in which he set a World Record was enough for him to get the gold"
"His outfits are always just so gorgeous,  his moves so fluid, and he’s my absolute favorite skater. I’m looking forward to seeing him compete this Winter Olympics ❤️"
"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Yuri on Ice and it did get me to love and appreciate the elegance and passion everyone puts into their skating..but these Yoi comments are flooding the Figure Skating comment sections."
Not his best performance but he is very talented !!! Congrats yuzuru !
Wow watching this and 2018 olympics made me realize how much he'd improved
He is so amazing 💕
"Where is his legendary SP performance??
Everyone should watch that!"
Even his fall is stunning
Yuzuru Hanyu is really amazing I'm so proud of him he's really doing the best of his best.....Love you YUZURU HANYU😊😊
But look at him now. The Best Male Figure Ice Skater...for me~
I love his outfit sm
He is so cute! 
❤❤❤❤❤❤amo muito ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
"Wow this guy is Awesome 👏
Proud Japan 🇯🇵 perfect 😘😘😘😘👏👏👏👏"
A living Angel
he's such a cutie that I want to protect.
"I cry everytime I see this, omgoodness"
this is what made me think of making an ice skating anime like Free! Iwatobi Swim Club....
19 years old 😢😢. I envy him
He's absolutely beautiful. Stunning 100% I love the Olympics
His outfit is so pretty!!
"The narrator wouldn't stop complaining, it's like he had just seen a really bad presentation. 
The dance fits so perfectly the music, the timing, the rhythm, it's so delicate, it's like he's weightless!"
I love how I can see that he improved since 2014 like... wow..
Сейчас 2022 а его произвольная олимпийская программа 2014 очень сложная в силовом смысле и в хореографическом и по вращения и по дорожкам 🙆‍♀️☝️😘❤️❤️❤️
"If you think this doesn't deserve the gold, watch Patrick Chan's GOLD MEDAL performance in World Championship 2013. Warning: lol."
I'm here still and again because of hanyu and ice skating itself
Yuzuru on Ice
The best for me!!!
Amazing
Qué belleza! Qué arte!
Sooooo handsome. Perfect Romeo
"I really appreciate the raw emotion he showed on his face upon seeing the score, and as noted by the commentator in so feelingly - ""he knows...he knows the door is very, very open"". I get the feeling that he smiles a lot because he is self-aware and grateful for many things, but this is one time when he shows that behind all that cute and lovely expressions, he is human after all."
"Although I'm a fan, I couldn't understand why he won gold with two falls and a few shaky landings. So I went to watch the other men's performances... Damn, they were disastrous. So although this wasn't Hanyu's best performance (his SP is way better) he did deserve the win."
悔しい金メダルなんて、羽生くんにしか言えないね
I really hope he compete 2022 n make it tripleeee gold!!!
"1st fall - the contemporary fall
2nd fall - hiphop style of get up ... "
he's so cute😍😍😍
new discovery of how wonderful skating is.
He is God of Ice❄
My favorite part is when he does that excellent Ina Bauer
"This has infinite love and grace, is the proof that god exists, thank you yuzuru"
You should upload his SP too !! That one was the best of the best 
"Wow, Yuri!!! on Ice brought me here but I never thought I'd actually be extremely interested in figure skating! Yuzuru's performances are so great and beautiful! I'd really like to learn more about the sport and try learning it myself, but with nearly 16 years I'm probably too old to start figure skating..."
Me cryin at 4am of how beautiful this is
✨️ Yuzuru Hanyu ✨️
What a handsome boy
"Right before start, that look in his eye is killing me 😂... such a handsome athletic and sportsmanship!"
"Please upload Yuzuru Hanyu's SP !!!!! 101+points performance, pleeeeese show us! 
I need to watch that program again and again. That SP was amazing! "
i come here because Yuri on Ice :'> ice skating is really beautiful!!
"one thing i realized after watching this, when failure got you, in front of people, or when you down and every single eyes on you, you have to remember that show must go on and life either. no pressed button to stop the time, or no rocks to hide you away. facing everything in front of you, don't run, and try to keep you head and heart calm. Whatever it is, life must go on."
"I would argue that the real Gold Medal winning performance was his Short Program, not this. "
Can't even stand on ice without falling on my face
I can‘t satisfy to only watch his video！！so now I am learning how to make a film for him🥰💖
Like if you *DID NOT* come here from Yuri!!! on ICE.
And then all the straight girls suddenly fell in love
"I can watch this all day
He makes ice skating so easy
Amazing"
FRICK I THOUGHT I WAS THW ONLY ONE WHO STARTED WATCHING FIGURE SKATING AFTER YURI ON ICE
"hey, I love yuri on ice as much as the next guy but instead of mentioning that you came from YOI or ""ITS YURI OMG"",  why not just appreciate YUZURU HANYU'S performance without comparisons to the show?"
"After four years, he still have his title of Olympics champion. What of a kind, Yuzu♥"
When a anime gets u really into a sport
ユズルは別格👍
今日が3度目のオリンピック。この時から8年も経った。どんな結果になろうと満足のいく滑りをしてくれたらなんでもいいです。みんな応援してます。
❤❤❤
"Yuzuru should be recognized for his talent and accomplishments, not for a character that was based off of him. Just saying 🙄"
"Watching this performance 4 years after Sochi, I'm amazing how better he is now"
hes so pretty~
"2024  1  24  （水）7：22
600万回視聴ですね。
朝から数種類の作品を見せてもらってます。
いいですね。最高の気分。
横浜Re_Pray 頑張って下さい。楽しみです。→ 🙏💓💖💝
お身体気をつけて下さい。今日は寒いです。昨日は雪が舞いました。
こちらはおかげで雪はあまり降らないので、朝から手も冷たくて気合を入れて💓❤"
I just happened to watch this young dancer and oh my goodness what a phenomenon he is!! I have never seen any other dancers on ice jumping so high and completing up to five turns in the air!... I love his style and artistic expression. 🥰
"Everyone is here from yuri on ice i'm here from dan howell , thanks dan for letting me see the most beautiful thing ever"
Glad I'm not the only one here from watching Yuri on Ice xD
"I love him so much, no matter how many years have passed I still love all his performance!"
"Man, I might be here because of Yuri on Ice, but only because I stopped watching after 2010, when Lillihammer got me hooked the first time! Got too busy with life/work but WHAT HAVE I MISSED! So good and so fun and my skating-otaku is back full force. :3 p.s. I think Yuri is more like Daisuke technically. XD Yuzuru is too good at jumps to have Yuri based on him. XD But man that short program. WOW"
"Can you hear
My heart beat"
LEGEND
He's cute too
"Some people are funny huh. I know this is not an ideal performance, but no man was better than him that day. Even PChan. Both of them had tedious long program, and both received score much much lower than their personal best. Since they scored almost equally in LP, it's reasonable that the one with best SP won. "
A beautiful skater
"Not his best but Chan made some costly mistakes too. He won fair and square. Surely I will go back to watch his SP performance many, many times because it was breathtaking!"
Can people stop comparing him to yuri on ice.
Meanwhile I'm here cuz I'm doing a project- a large painting for a sports idol. I chose him cuz gosh I admire this guy. Yuzuru's beautiful skating got me inspired to execute a movement in art that will simply look mesmerising and easily catch the project judges. So much to talk about during the presentation
I see all these anime fans... MY PEOPLE
Raise your hand if you're here because you watched Yuri on ice. Now put your hand down.
Wow... Yuzuru  is such an excellent talent. Love you for it.
Does anyone else find the reporter's voice hilarious?!
"Just imagine, had Plushenko not withdrew and Hanyu skated clean, the Gold was already planned for Plunshenko even if he just stood there on the ice rink for 4 minutes doing much about nothing. LOL"
천상계입니다  최고예요
羽生結弦選手は神‼️
"Geez, what was up with the men's free skate? Nearly everybody fell over. O.o Oh well, I'd have given Hanyu the gold for that awesome short program alone."
"I don’t know what it is about him, but he has such a seemingly light spirit and something so adorable about him <3"
figure skating brought me to Yuri!!! On ice.
I came here before I knew there has Yuri!!! on ice XD
"Happy anniversary, everyone! And most importantly, congrats Yuzuru Hanyu on five years since turning that crazy, wild dream of yours into a reality! If you ever see this, I want you to know how much this gold medal and all the others you've won since then combined your amazing character have inspired so many people to follow in your footsteps of realizing their own dreams and to fall in love with the absolutely beautiful sport of figure skating. Thanks for then, now, everything in between, and all that is to come!"
"Wow, he's so amazing. And at 19? Damn. But, he made a lot of mistakes, didn't he? How did he still get gold? Eh. I've seen his other performances, he's magnificent. - Also I've seen a lot of comments on this one anime that I love, and I'm happy to know that it peeves other people off as much as it does too me; shouldn't you admire Yuzuru's performance instead of acting all... weaboo? Or at-least... y'know- act less crazy-obssesed on the anime?"
"So what did tou want, Chan winning the gold with THREE sloppy performances? He didn't skate ONE clean program through all the Olympics, at least Hanyu showed two flawless wonderful SP!!"
and he beat the short program record again...hnngh im so proud of him
"Yuri on Ice brought me here. But nevermind that, this young man. I'm his new fan."
"Yuzu, let his nerves get to him. In fact, I think that all the men did. Ultimately the second day of the Men's Skating was down to who made the least number of mistakes. But the nerves aren't the only thing that contributed to the falls.. the scheduling was bad..The short program was on the 13th and the free on the 14th.. because of the side by side day scheduling.. the men were fighting fatigue by the second day. Also remember that the event went all the way into late night (so if you were set to go 20th you probably skated at 9 or 10 P.M and there were 30 skaters total).. so I don't think they got enough rest.

If the schedule had given one day leeway between the men's short and free.. it would have helped a lot. There was also the team events before hand too... 

Sochi overall was just weird. But none the less, a great fight in the free program by all the men! :) "
Omg he is grace.  These moves. He is just like flying. I could watch him for hours.
"Could someone explain to me how figure skating is scored? Like are the points from his short program carried forward to the free skate, and that's why yuzuru won gold? I'm lost on how he won gold despite his falls - no disrespect intended, I'm a huge fan of him but I just have no clue how skating is scored 😂"
"""Omg people need to stfu about Yuri on Ice! It's disrespectful blah blah...*continues on in a paragraph*""
The irony: *contributed to the accumulating Yuri on Ice comments*"
most majestic person ive ever seen
Wait he fell twice and still won?! .......... What a legend !! Lol
didnt Yuri based on Daisuke Takahashi? why all comment in Yuzuru?
He can go skate and fall 100 times and he still will be the G.O.A.T 🐐
I bet most of the commenters came here because of Yuri on Ice XD
Why are Asians so good looking! 
He is gorgeous
WHO IS HERE TO SEE THE REAL LIFE YURI XDDD
"He's absolutely beautiful, He's the guy that Yuri was based off of right??"
i dont know anyone who can do it like him. he is the best man in figure skating...!
please upload his SP
Who came here because of yuri on ice?!
Can we just take a moment to appreciate and admire this costume? Such perfection
"He is so cute, I just want to pinch his cheeks."
"honestly if you came here from the Yuri on ice!!! anime, and just looked up people just for characters, I am disappointed."
"この頃のビジュアルと演技がとてつもなく好き戻りたいあの感動をもう一度味わいたい
やっぱスケートの全盛期って10代から20代前半なんだろうな"
"Gods those commentators ruined it for me at times rofl (l mean, was the comment about ""well that's not gonna break a world record!"" really necessary. Also, I try not to judge people on Japanese pronunciation cause glass houses, but the ""han(d)-you"" made me cringe)"
I wish he was my boyfriend I love him so sooo much <3
"I felt that the moment he fell, that surge of panic... then he picked himself up right away like “well the worst thing already happened, so now I’ll just i my best from here” and was calm after"
vIKtOr MusT Be PrOUd!
Happy 9th anniversary💙👑🥇👶🏻
Божественный Юдзуру!
I find myself spacing out and just staring at the screen. It is nearly impossible to watch him without falling down into this rabbit hole and I am so inspired and awed by him.
Who else's heart ached when he fell. He's so talented and people are beginning to expect a lot from him
"I was looking for reference videos to see the body angles and movements of a figure skater and accidentally fell in love with Yuzuru, thanks I'm a fan of him now"
"Так страшно когда они подают...  столько сложных элементов надо сделать...
Первый раз так сложно поэтому смотреть....

Потрясающая пластика... безумно классно. Искусство на льду. 👏👏👏"
Congratulations Yuzu on your 2nd Olympic gold medal! 4 years have passed by too quickly.
Magnificent representation of how life should be lived. Thank you!
"Bravo Yuzuru, porque te sabes levantar con gran inteligencia de cualquier obstáculo que se presente en la vida.
El verte patinar me hace el momento y me invita para hacer ejercicio.
Sigue subiendo tus vídeos y muchas, muchas bendiciones para tu futuro."
Absolutely beautiful ❤️
"i'm so in love with him and with the way he does what he loves, seriously. it's beautiful."
He's beautiful ❤️
Hard work behind this. Respekt.
"He's so sweet! If you watch his interviews he is the kindest person, and so cute ♡ so proud of him!"
Какие же афигенные костюмы ему шьют
beautiful
"私だったら1回の失敗の後頭真っ白になって何もかも台無しにしちゃうと思う…(私だったらとかおこがましすぎるけど)
リンク上で1秒も漏らさず美しくあり続けた羽生選手の強靭な精神力に感服。この時18歳くらいだよね…"
To think he fell and even got the gold medal it self tells us that he was the best among all and even if he fell he was more than good enough then his competitors... love and respect for him
"okay, this is so beautiful and i'm crying"
"Смотрю в 2024, он и сейчас лучший фигурист планеты, неповторимый и  непревзойденный...."
I only saw his very last dance live on tv that brought him the metal. I had never heard of him but good lord he is amazing!
I think he was nervous at the beginning but somehow managed to clear his mind and focused on what he's doing and performed a phenomenal program.
"Now i know what i will do in 2022 olympic it is gonna be fun!! I will be a sport fan for the first time 

I literally know him for less then a week but man let me tell you he is amazing inspiring cutie peace of cloud!!!!!!!"
"He is prince of ice ,bravo"
You can see the emotions of Romeo and Juliet in the program and visualize their whole story in 4 minutes and 30 seconds through Yuzuru Hanyu.
Whattttttttt....this is really beautiful...
I watched yuri on ice years ago never liked sports or such but i ended up seeing this man in my recommends and fell in love with his performance and everything about him. He worked very hard to be where he’s at and became such a legend
Please never retire. Please. Just. Don't.
"this skate was absolutely fantastic despite the tumbles but I really want to point out his coach Brian because the relationship between them is incredible and he's a wonderful mentor. he told him it was alright and that's all anyone wants when you're disappointed in yourself and I think the way they work together in amazing, they look like true friends and even as far as Brian taking on a father figure for him."
"4:30 All of his Ina Bauer are beautiful and gorgeous, but the angle of this camera is the best. It seems the world is spinning around him."
I love watching him skate 😻
How could you be this amazing
I first saw him at pyeongchang olimpiades and he was really amazing. Maybe i'm a fan now.
I live for his costumes!! First place for fashion!
Absolutely amazing! He deserved that gold medal!
Only Hanyu can still claim gold with technically unclean programs-that's how amazing of an artist he is.
Expressive skating
Landing at 3:40 was hella clean
Even though he messed up in a few places this is my favourite from Sochi
watchin him like a poem...he is always amazing...loves
Beautiful performance !!! Very Amazing 💛🐦💙
"maybe because of the song, my heart was pounding like crazy and why was I even holding my breath? gosh"
I'm  watching Hanyu's Amazing figure skating skills this 2020.  I SHOULD'VE STAN HIM EARLIER
👑 rei do gelo 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Хочется увидеть его на чемпионате  мира 2022.Несравненный Юдзуру !!!
"Though I got into figure skating from Yuri on ice, I love the beauty of real skaters like this. Though he fell quite a bit, it still showed the determination he had and he got SO MUCH BETTER in 2018! I love that you can see that improvement and it shows true talent to me! ok dats it bye..."
YUZU'S THE GOAT
索契十年打卡～❤
"Все люди, как люди, а он красив, как Бог!"
A king since young age.
A rose will bloom and then will fade.. so does the youth.. so does the fairest maid..
"I hope we can all appreciate Yuzuru Hanyu as a skater, his technique and programs are beautiful and he is a big inspiration for many. 
I hope I can be just as good as him one day."
"Yuzuru won fair and square. He fell on the 4S, had a huge step out on the 3F (which was classified as a fall), and had his 1L-3S combo at the back of his 3Lz invalidated for transfer of weight (not very fair IMO).

In comparison, Patrick had a step out/hand down on the 2nd 4T, a big step out from his 3A, popped the 3S to a 2S, and to cap it off, stepped out on the 2A (the easiest jump in his program). 

It wasn't exactly the win that Yuzuru wanted and this fuelled his determination to compete and win decisively at Pyeongchang (which he did - becoming the first man in 66 years to defend his gold). But a win is a win, and considering Yuzuru skated a lights out SP, he definitely deserved to win."
Incredible performance ❤️❤️❤️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Lets make it to 4 millions
Yuzuru hanyu documentales  patinaje tu vida cuando era pequeño
My love ❤❤❤❤
He should skate as long as possible for World :)
"and today Yuzuru has won the second consecutive gold at the Pyeongchang Olympics.
The Legend and the King of figure skating of all time!"
两天后的比赛请加油！ 他这次在beijing2022冬奥会 中国粉丝超级多 直播平台全部被支持他的粉丝占据！超人气！虽然短节目落后 希望他最后能取得好成绩！
羽生结弦 ！ ！ ！哇哦 ！真的巨喜欢这套节目 ！
watching this has me so excited to see him this week in pyeongchang . get gold yuzu !!!
"His skating is so smooth, like he’s weightless. And everything fits the music perfectly, I love it"
my heart fell with him😭😭
"I was here since I had an idea for a namjin fanfiction involving skating, and I searched ""figure skating beautiful man"", and I have never agreed more with the search results in my whole life."
A time for us🥰🥰🥰 Yuzu choise my favourite R and J soundtrack😘😘🌹🌹🌹💯💯😇😇😇
Love you😘😘😘😍😍🤗🤗💙💙❤❤🖤🖤
"Yuzuru de mi corazón, siempre serás el mejor, el más talentoso, el más hermoso, el más humilde,dulce y tierno,siempre!♡"
Ele eh perfeitooo lindo maravilhosooo feito por Deus🙏🎁❤❤
He's a master on the ice no matter what! Just adore him
"Wish we could enjoy Yuzuru's majestic performance and the heavenly music of Romeo and Juliet WITHOUT the commentators.
His beautiful performance far out weighs the stumbles  ....nerves just got the best of him...."
here i am watching this to see his performance and to also see how he is still graceful while he falls like what : D
"He is honestly so amazing, I love his ability to stay cool and keep going."
Born to make history!
He really is talented I’m happy he got the gold
"Ya know, i got more invested in figure skating because of Yuri On Ice, but thats not the reason im here. Im here because i love Yuzuru Hanyu's skating, and figure skating in general."
even when they fall they are still graceful
it freaking hurts so much after falling on ice. But he got up right after without any pain expression on his face. Idk else but i can relate to how much pain he managed there.
I love yuzuru
my heart fell along with him at the start of this program
i wanna cry everytime i watch him perform
Just like feather🥰
"He was not skating,he was flying"
*BORN TO MAKE HISTORY*
"I am binging on figure skating performances and all i can is ""beautiful""."
"He Is Excellent !!! I admire him! He is a lover of wind and passion can be seen above anything, I am not a follower of figure skating but when i see a Yuzuru, i see art, he emboldens that feeling for his sport like few others. ... I see him, and WooooW It's amazing! my admiration for him, he will always have my support."
"Hermosa rutina  🎊🎉 Te queremos Yuzuru, te queremos!!! 💞 Cuídate en tus prácticas y sube tus vídeos , nunca pierdas ese niño que llevas dentro y siempre sé feliz 💓💗"
"Sūnau,tu geriausias!Gimęs ant ledo !"
"Even though he looked uneasy but he was still slaying, smiling and being beautiful! You did great sweetie✨💕😭😘😭"
i actually love that you can fall in iceskating and still win. because gymnastics for example is so ruthless that one tiny mistake can cost you everything and forced perfectionism isnt what a sport should only be about. thats why there are so many accidents and injuries there and you rarely get to see beautiful programs because almost everything is about the technical score these days
He was born to make history
oh pls im still crying
"I think Patrick had it coming... I mean, every person said he would win gold (which puts too much pressure on someone) and he also didn’t seem to think he could lose against Hanyu. 

It feels weird now, since Patrick just said he is officially retired and... it makes me remember how times flies for skaters. 

Maybe Yuzuru will retire in four years or less, I don’t know. It is scary, how the life of skaters as that, skaters, is pretty “short”. Not all people are like Plushenko, pushing past the limits of their own health, so it’s pretty common that they retire when they are 20-25 

Patrick Chan retired, Javier Fernandez, and probably Misha Ge will retire too... god, we need to enjoy every single moment of our favorites in this beautiful sport, we don’t know when it will be the last one."
he's really awesome!  but wait...  19 y. o????? howw wonderfulllll is this!
Double olympic gold medalist <3
So graceful ♡
❤最棒的羽生结弦
We love you 💜💜💜
If he fell and was able to get gold bihh he really is doing something spectacular
This takes so much more raw skill and talent than football does.
"He’s talented, magical, charming and handsome 😍😍😍 he’s a full package! Omg this boy makes me crazy 🤩"
Yuzuru on ice💛🍵💛
he makes even falling look like a masterpiece
only this man can make falling look so graceful
BRAVO.
太帥了😍😍😍
3:25 that entry blows our minds every time we see it 🤯
"i can't stop watching how beautiful he is on the ice.everything he does is perfection and cleanly done, He is definitely the favourite at the moment next to Tessa virtue and Scott Moir"
just imagining yuzuru japan and kim yuna s.korea perform together ........HOLY ...
GOAT
Amazing!!!
still beautiful
"What a fall! Glad he still won the medal though he totally deserved it! Amazing work here even if their were falls, what matters is how he handled all the pressure and at least didn't do more mistakes than he already made!"
When Im here Im cry
"He still did amazing and you can't change my mind, especially being that he as asthma"
ウィンタースポーツの、男子シングルを、華やかな世界へと変えた、先駆者と、なられました。
it’s so sad how you can just feel his confidence drop after he messes up that first jump... love you Yuzuru 💕
"HE WON GOLD THIS YEAR TOO!


bless this bean"
"Yo amo a este hombre , claro que descubrí quien era muy tarde, pero igual lo admiro mucho <3"
"Фантастика жмётся в углу перед Гением Юдзуру! Обожаю, браво браво, брависсимо!!!!!"
THE LEGEND
Wow I'm rewatching this for the first time since the Sochi olympics and you can see how much progress he's made since
"i dont know how to explain like. something about the way the mood shifted when the music changed, idk—i was kind of emotional watching this and i dont know why"
Love love love love love love love love love love love you yuzu baby... always stay blessed...
Tbh he even looked graceful when he failed that jump.  If i didnt know any better i wouldnt even realize he fell.
Who's here after yuzuru retirement
Yuzuru is gorgeous in every possible way.
Fantastic!
I can feel the aura😍😍
"Ah I so sad when he falls. It breaks my heart! 😭
I love him so much. 💜💜"
He fell twice and still got gold. That's crazy! His skating is super clean and precise tho
"he so good, he got gold despite missing his first jump (and it's a quadruple salchow at that, I cant even do a slalow on one foot)"
"Beautiful,calm but also adrenaline pumping,wow😍😍"
Still love this!!
hes got a lot to give till 2022 Olympics. he'll get his historical third gold. i'm sure of it.
"he skates gracefully..

"Meu coração vibra com música , meus olhos não conseguem parar de acompanhá-lo e ver como a música se conecta com o corpo é simplesmente surpreendente"
Ya me olvidé las veces que lo vi patinar. Un clásico Romeo y julieta.y Juzuru TAMBIÉN un clásico hermoso..
"The music and the commentator 

They’re both so intense. Jesus. Stop making my heart drop XD"
i came here to see what the fuss with this boy was all about and it seems like i’ve fallen into the yuzuru hole too he’s so beautiful hfkdhdjd
"I got this recommendation after I watched yuri on ice, I clicked on it and didn’t regret"
"Hanyu-san is very beatiful! 
😍😍"
Get well soon yuzu ❤
Woa talent and handsome. 🤩
Even putting it on speed x0.25 can't keep up with the speed of his jumps and spins💀
Yuri on ice really gave him a Lot of recognition for his talents and its incredible looking back onto today how much hes improved and everything he has achieved at such a young age. *amazingggg*
A beautiful Manga prinz.
This is the most painful of his skate to watch. but knowing how he got his revenge and won his second Olympic just makes want to watch his stake again
"He’s so adorable and such an amazing skater, support him, I hope he’ll be in the 2020 olympics as well, I love watching him perform with all his talent💙"
Who is here 10 years later ?
im holding my breath for those fall at the start. But Yuzuru is stunning
His costumes are always the best this year I loved his costume he looked like an adorable anime character
God that Ina Bauer is amazing...
The best of the world!
Гений! Супер!
That was pure..... Art full of emotion
Такого фигуриста.в историии не было.
Amor infinito a Yuzuru!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
"Ничего что упал, все просто отлично  ,устал, напряжение большое и ещё молодой ,успехов в дальнейшей профессиональной подготовке.Привет из Белоруссии!!!Раиса!"
So beautiful always
유즈 로미오😍😍
"As long as his happy I'm proud
😄👍"
"tbh,, the announcers need to shut up. like you try doing a quadruple and NOT falling. let alone recovering so quickly and proficiently while STILL maintaining composure. ❤"
素晴らし
This week he won another gold!  First man in forty years  to defend gold
帅柚子
How beatifull 💗💗💗💗💗
Hes so pretty though like 😤
He did incredible considering the state of the ice
八年前他就是卓尔不群，八年后的他更是如宝剑一般越磨越锋。
"Yet he only 19,yassssss boy u go😁🤗😘😘👍👍👍😘"
You’re amazing!
It is just a shame he didnt win any medal this year...:{
"He has good job 
And he is full beauty"
He's absolutely amazing and cute!
YUZURU WE LOVE YOU:(
"It looks like his ancle still was hurting. However, his skating just pulls you in. Such a magnificent scater!"
he's so graceful im cryin
"This isn't really the gold medal winning performance, it was his flawless record-breaking short program that won him the medal. Can't wait to see him again in PyeongChang"
I'm here because I enjoy watching figure skating its the only olympic sport I watch and yes I also love yuri on ice as well
He's exquisite ♥️
I'm here because of Yuri on ice. And thanks to that I saw a man who's a legend.
역대 최고 피겨선수 하뉴님
"i don't know how hard it was for him, he was the one who break the records, and this performance maybe out from his mind too. but he could finish his show. and that's the matterest thing."
"He won because he broke a freaking WORLD RECORD at his SP. And regarding the falls and everything, in the LP NO SKATER WAS AT YUZURUS LEVEL. (Take into account that the rest of startlist made huge mistakes during this session) Ps: I love how smiley he was even though he made a couple of mistakes in the most important day of his career. GRANDISSIMO."
MY LOVE ❤❤❤ LEGEND 😍
2024 anyone?
羽生結弦さん凄いです👏
感動する🥺
"En esta oportunidad se le ve muy cansado, yo creo ese agotamiento provocó sus caídas.. Aún así lo resolvió con mucha determinación, Bravo!!"
he is growing on ice
i love how all these videos are titled wins gold metal because he wins every time haha
4:31 the angle is killing me it's so beautiful
"He’s sooooo cute, talented & sweet!"
Yuzuruuu wow
Send help I can’t stop watching his videos
Woah he has improved soooo much
even with the fall yuzu is great dan others skater..
"How does he make falling look like art, is the real question."
"Everyone's like ""am I the only person yo be here because of him and not yuri on ice"" even if! Then they now found yuzuru hanyu and probably loving him/his skating. And everyone knows how to appreciate true art 🙄"
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Очень люблю катание Ханью. Просто наслаждаюсь.
"And everytime he fell... i Just thought: Damm, this was beautiful"
"👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
""A joy to watch...""
🪶"
"And after this, to rewatch his reaction when he knew he won.. work hard paid."
Foarte frumos Felicitari😍
baby zuzu❤
I want to cry😩😭😍
I wish I can get up from this fall and win it.... he is really amazing! !
"HE IS SO PRETTY , THATS WHAT made HIM WON!"
19 years old!!!
Красавчик слов нет
I LOVE YOU KING
今回も取れて良かったね！
"i was here because yuri on ice brought me here,i stayed here ecause of yuzuru,this is worth the watch like- he is so beautiful and elegant tbh"
That's it I'm inlove
"I don’t know why but sometimes seeing him fall is almost reassuring. It’s like, that man, him, one of the most legendary figure skaters like ever, can still make mistakes, and it’s like a reminder that he started from not knowing what he was doing too. It’s almost like a reassurance that one day, random dumb kids like us could get to where he is, it’s like a reminder that he’s human and capable of messing up just like us, and I don’t know, something about seeing it happen just gives me a strange sense of hope. It’s kind of weird, I know."
十九歳の結弦君金メダルおめでとうございます。
"He's so gorgeous and talented ;-; 






i feel useless"
Such cutie 😍😍😍
WOW!
He's human folks - the pressure got to him.
"To be honest, i also think why he won gold medal if he falls. Then people say to watch other skater video and i understand why. Hanyu Yuzuru have a nice flow even when he make mistakes. His glides are effortless and this jump are near perfect compared to other skater. So, overall, his skate has flaws but better than other in comparisons. I understand"
He did it again in 2018
I'm really holding my breath every time he jumps
4:32 just hits different you know. It always brings up the chills.
結弦様が、演目の、ドラマ性を、大胆な表現で、表したいという、その情熱が、難しい演技への、挑戦を、かのうにしていらっしゃいます。
Aaaawww such a cutiiieee 😚
King
このロミジュリが羽生きゅんとの出会いだったなぁ🥺
Brian is a sweet coach!!! ❤️
I love him so much 😻
The way they pronounced Yuzuru Hanyu omg
"To those who questions his performances, I believe they may be are specialists on technical  aspects in skating. How about sitting there as judge(s) next time YUZU competes.  Or, better still  have the pool of judges e x p l a i n...... For me, YUZU is one of the great SKATERS,  of the world!"
❤❤❤❤❤
You know what? His slim good looking figure help him to win the game beside the technical difficulties of his program.
"All others also made mistakes, pressure got into them,  Patrick Chan too.  So the one made less mistake and with more difficulties won."
Yuzuru!!! on Ice
"I recently got into Ice skating after watching Yuna Kim perform in the 2010 Winter Olympics. 

It’s cool that a bunch of you came from the anime, but please don’t disrespect the skater and the performance by relating it to an anime. I am positive that to be compared to a fictional character was not the reason he chose to skate."
Awaaaa hes so cute
He fixed the game.
"Yall- Falling on Jumps or taking off on an unclear or incorrect edge can cause deductions but there are other elements to figure skating than just jumps, did you see how centred his spins were? Did you see the step sequences and artistry? The facial expressions and how he pays attention to placement of his hands. Those elements are what drove him to the top, Falls are not the only thing that matter, if you think only jumps matter, you clearly dont understand the sport and need to start researching more about the elements before you start going on about how he made it to the top even after the falls."
I don't know ice skating comment etiquette but when he fell it hurt me inside and i think he's pretty
i'm really glad with Yuri!!! on ice because ice skating is now my favorite sport thanks to this anime <3
感动 当之无愧的第一名
a. fuggin. legend
He's so cute and delicate
"He is the best, king of ice <3 <3"
Soooooo proud omgggg
Maravilhoso!!
これいこうめざましいかつやくすばらしいですね❗
"Pra mim, é uma das apresentações mais lindas e emocionante de todas... Não importa se ele caiu."
He’s beautiful ..
He is awesome！
his form is sublime
"For those old skating fans who love to say that old skaters r better than the new skaters because they r more clean, just go read new rules and pls try to understand that athletes put their strategy base on the rules.The old 6.0 era emphasized on clean skate than landing quad jumps while in new era skating, skater win by getting highest counting point and mostly if u can't land quad jump that have high point, then u lose.If Yuzuru Hanyu had to compete in 6.0 era which clean skate was matter the most and fell on jump mean lost, then he wouldn't risk to put 4S that he didn't have enough consistent at that time, he wouldn't risk to fall on it and contribute to lose confident for next jump like domino, he would listen to his coach Brian that wanted him to put only 4T. The rules were stupidly design in a way that u gain more points on fully rotated quad even fall on the ice than clean triple jump, if u were the athletes, what will u jump?And if old skaters had to compete in new rule, they all would lose because they couldn't jump quad which had high point(And I didn't mean they r less capable than new skater but at that time nobody really practiced to jump quad and quad make skaters inconsistent)
Yagudin said he is athlete but Yuzuru Hanyu is god of new figure skating. Pluchenko said now Yuzuru is his idol. And that say a lot."
"🎉🎉🎉結婚おめでとう！💕💖
少し休んで、また元気な顔、素晴らしい演技をを見せて下さい。
今日10日、２弾のSharePracticeですね。12日は、NHKのおげんさんに出演、楽しみです。

来年は、羽生君のショーに行きたいです。それにはチケットをゲットしないと😁大変です。
何年か先、何十年か先？　２ショット？　３？４？　見せてくれる日まで待ちます。
幸せになって下さい。
私も、結構４日から８日まで大変でしたが、本当に今は、心から羽生選手の演技を楽しみにしています。💖💖💖心から幸せを祈っています。

ファンの多くの人も、本気で応援していた分、中にはショックな人もいるかと。
でも多くのファンの人は、また元のように戻ってくれると信じてます。
みんな羽生選手の演技が大好きな人達。

毎日、羽生君の演技を見ています。涙を流しながら感動し、見て楽しんでいます。
羽生君の小さい時から、ロミジュリの演技に元気をもらって感動した演技、オリジン、オトナル　SEIMEI　バラード１　ロンカプ、・・・最近は阿修羅ちゃん始め、こんなに？というくらい楽しみに見ています。
毎日、羽生君の顔を見ない日はありません。💖💖💖💖💖　　　　2023、8、10"
"ソチ五輪の金メダルは羽生結弦選手だけ！
このプログラムアイスショーでまた見たいなぁ"
"Quads are difficult to land. Some jumps require you to essentially jump off your tippy toes and land on specific sides for different jumps. Short and free programs demand an immense amount of stamina out of you, more than most other sports. Not to mention the smooth twists and maneuvers and balance you need for other tricks!

He was doing this difficult program on an injury with painkillers to help him get through this skate. Much respect to Yuzuru and all figure skaters out there. Jumps are definitely a difficult aspect of figure skating and the fact figure skaters bolstered that spin to 4 is ridiculous and nearly humanly impossible despite the fact that a lot of strong figure skaters can perform quads and make it LOOK easy. 

Don’t quickly dismiss somebody just because you see them fall in figure skating jumps."
Try zen to have faults and win gold That beauty in the broken thing
"it pisses me off that people are shitting on him for falling. figure skating is much more than just jumps. it's also artistry, spins, and footwork. there are so many components that one mistake isn't going to tank your score. educate yourself before you try to question the people who literally dedicate their entire lives to this."
Conclude il programma olimpico con una grande prestazione. Ora è nell'olimpo in mazzo agli Dei.
"I would look like a new born giraffe if I even attempted to go on the ice, even without all of these complicated tricks added. 
Figure skating always looks so magical, I can remember the first time I saw it on tv and couldn't close my mouth during the whole programm."
Thats Yuzuru On Ice!👍😍👍
every time a skater falls my heart stop for a second x_x
4:34 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
"how can man be more beautiful than me. like wow he so ethereal, his moves"
its beautifulHe's worth it.
Love that you're using an Australian commentator for this official video.
"I Like him,just he is himself"
"Tell me if i'm crazy, but the song that yuzuru uses is the same that sasha cohen used in torino 2006.
And that's not all, there is also the fact that in both performances, both fell twice at the beginning of their routines, but after that they culminated excellently.
The big diference is that cohen won a silver medal and yuzuru won gold medal.
What a great coincidence."
I have fallen in love with his fall
"Yuzuru fell 
Me : “fallen angel 🥹”"
"Ele caindo no primeiro giro, quase fez meu coração parar"
"The 2018 Yuzu makes his old self look clumsy, and it's unbelievable"
His outfit 💅✨
Fantastisch!!! Bravo!!!
Am I the only one who watch yuri on ice because of yuzuru?
"Все равно он фантастичен, не смотря на ошибки в прокате, он все равно легенда!"
Everyone is saying they're here because of yuri on ice but it's the opposite for me
❤️❤️❤️
That was so good 👌
So proud of these skaters. I easily get dizzy when I scroll too much in my cp while they can do quadruple whatever. 😂🎉
He got highest score but look like he's not satisfied of his score because he fell down but he really did great
I know that music!!!😂😂😂 it was from Romeo and Juliet from the movie the song is called What is a Youth
*Yuzuru on ice*
And he is back on ice to win their second gold on PyeongChang Olympics. Fly Yuzuru FLY!
Oh! Yuzuru’s coach is Kim Yuna’s coach in Olympic  2010. He’s the great coach.
Он еще только начинал.
"Ahhh, I wished I was nurtured in a skill like this growing up..."
10年🥲
またこの衣装着てほしいな☺
❆my love is simply amazing no matter how many times it falls it raises and continues more❆ ❆♥beautifully still I'm completely in love my Yuzu♥❆
"Everytime he Fell I screamed two things : DON'T BE HUUUUUUUURT! IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ICE!


I'm just a random fan xD"
Love him
For everyone saying he fell a lot so did the other skaters
いつもありがとう    心の美容体操させてもらっています  ゆずさん大ファンです   ありがとうございます
I'll not be surprised if it turned out that he used to sit near the window during his school days
"Ok we get it, everyone in the comments, appreciate him and not just Yuuri on Ice WE GET IT 😂😂😂 I appreciate him alone not just YOI"
Amazing
"Great song, Romeo and Juliet"
Espero que las próximas olimpiadas pueda ir completamente sano y ahora sí pueda tener a su entrenador
ÚNICO SINGULAR!!
Go yuri!!!
omg の素晴らしい yuruzu は、日本のために行う

An icon
He so good 😘😘😘 yous deserve it

Thank you for the video."
Awesome
Such grace
"Tell me people has your skater ever fallen? The answer is yes, yes they absolutely have. Now tell me are you even a fan of the sport? If you were you probably wouldn't be bashing other skaters."
I screamed when he fell 🥺😭 why am i so dramatic 🤦‍♀️

"*""the deed is done, he has left the door wide opening and he knows""* 
title: gold medal winning performance 
me: better google what medal he got"
"There was the obvious evidence that show how he skate, he competed with himself and so disappointed with his performance. And he know if he was on point, he would win it anyway."
I feel embarrassed everytime they fall omg but good for him for getting gold.
"Alexei yagudin
Evgeni plushenko 
And now....Yuzuru haniu"
"I'm not trying to compare, I just found it interesting that Shcherbakova would've won this Olympics in both the women's and men's events (even without a triple axel or quads in short program), if the men's PCS was worth the same as women's. Congrats to Yuzu though! A well deserved win and so ahead of the rest of the competition at the time."
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
アイスの天使。💙
"Him:triple axel 
Reporter: Not a great landing tho 
Me:blinking me eyes when I’m not even able to walk strait most of the time 😅"
My heart stopped when he fell the first time xddd
I can't believe..... Is he human..??
Go yuri!!!
Falls keep fighting and shows what u really capable of.
He's actually extremely cute .
Bo-bo-born to make history...!
"Transmite tanto, se me pone la piel de gallina"
Lindo amo patinação no gelo. Assisto  todas as olimpíadas de inverno.👏
He really did that
I needed 7 years to realize that his 3S after the 3Lz got zero points. Why was that?
no toys on the ice yet. Hello from the end of 2019
"I wanna marry him, man!! He is so elegant."
"I think the music for Romeo and Juliet is cursed. Sasha Cohen had the same errors (falling on first jump, bending and touching the ice on the second one) when she skated to this music in 2006. But like him, she went on to skate beautifully thereafter."
Amazing And very beutiful!!!!!
"He had 2 mistakes but it isn’t that bad. Sure the second triple axel was a bit shaky but it was still clean and I feel like he shouldn’t have lost the triple salchow from the lutz sequence which until I recently checked the PDF, didn’t even realized was omitted"
He is so ... flowy xd
I just can’t understand why are people talking while he’s skating
"His performance is fantastic, I can help to watch it again and again, but who could explain how the score is given to bring him a gold medal even so many fall?"
"Me: *watching this video *
Mom: *from another room * Are you doing you homework?
Me:
Me:
Me:...um-hmmm..."
"Amo esse garoto, muito carismático"
I got Intrested in ice skating after watching yuri on ice
I think 2018 programs were even better
😍😍😍
ok but like for actual once I saw the story as he told it like wow that's never happened to me before go Yuzu
"Y’all, explain to me why I’m crying"
❤️❤️❤️😍
who’s back in 2019?
这才是花样滑冰
"sort program 2014 =101

Watching figure skaters fall stresses me out SO much; and imagine how they feel like AHH
Parece que  patina. A cámara lenta!!. se recrea para que el espectador disfrute
💜
Now I don't know much about figure skating and I'm not the best ice skater myself but I don't understand how he fell a couple times and also didn't land well on others? Everything else about it was beautiful though.
Es el amor de mi vida you can't change my mind
"4:07 ‘little bit of a stumble’ well, why don’t you say that to sotnikova."
爱羽生结弦
Yuzuru
I LOVE the camerawork here!!! really!!
I will sell my life just to be an ice rink in my next life. I would gladly scraped on with the blade that yuzu's using😭
"Haters, grade of difficulty and artistry!  Learn to understand what makes a great skate!"
"He was 19, (sochi 2014), 23 (pyongchang 2018).. so he is 24 in 2019.. okay. Sorry guys i just have to do my maths in sentence 😂"
Does anyone else imagine him as Victor and Yuuris  love child?
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"not perfect, but he has legendary SP, so, it okay, but these skating skills can say so much, this tech, its like a dream them he is skating!!!"
I could never I'd have so much second hand embarrassment
"He kinda reminds me of the realistic version of yuuri 
Mistakes and errors but grace and beauty
😊🤧😊🤧😊🤧"
4:30 😍😍😍
"Me: Watches Yuri On Ice
Also me: Realise...that I was watching this."
He's a snack omg
Kim Yuna and Yuzuru have a same teacher
Good performance
I felt the pain when he fell omg
"Honestly, I feel like all the contestants were robbed with what the competition did—They didn’t give a bad performance, but they were given a bad skate to rink in and made to do so while still tired from the short performance."
you have no idea how much anxiety I had watching this. the people speaking didn't hELP 💔
美丽的朱丽叶
😍😍😍
I love this performance <3 I've watched this video so many times but... someone knows what is the title of the music at the end of video (from 9:00)?
I was sooo surprised when he fell TTTT
i have a new crush
"these comments:
30%: “wow!! yuzu is so amazing. what a talent!”
60%: “am i the only one here for yuzu??? who cares about Zuri On Spice 😡”
10%: people actually just talking about yuri on ice"
この頃はサルコウで転んでたのに今は普通に飛んでるもんなー
Patinage artistic is first ART Jump should never be above the artistic side... He got everything of this side the jump are a plus so whenever he miss them... He still is everything.
Come on IOC release the 2018 performance already 😑
"Eles jogam buquês ^^ Que bunituh

Amei a apresentação, por mais que tenham alguns erros, foram falta de um pouco de sorte ^^"
Брайан такой молодой здесь. А всего- то 6 лет прошло....
"If I ever do ice skating, I'd would've fell through the ice."
Did you see me go inline skating in Jeju Island?👍🏻👍🏻
4:32 gave me CHILLS
I liked his Romeo and Juliet from 2012 better :)
How'd He Win Gold with two falls like that. Amazing.
Yuzuri on ice!!!
So clean with the level of detail in his motions... Yuzu is ice king.. dare I bring up Yuna as ice queen.. she should've gotten two gold medals too.. shady Russians..  glad they got banned this year.
Cuteeee
Can it please be a rule that while the performers perform the narrator stays quiet? 😅
Керемет!!!
威水❤😂🎉
Yuzuru ha
Сколько раз пересмотрели 4:32?)
this olympics was so fun bc for all the other medal contenders to get gold they would just have to not fall and every single peson fell multiple times it was a riot
"Wait is this the song from the Romeo and Juliet movie? Not the Leonardo Dicaprio one, the old, traditional one. I just noticed but it still suits Yuzu so well ^^"
🤩🤩🤩🤩
"Who watching this and fall for figure skating after watching ""Yuri!!! On Ice"" anime? Me!✌😉✌"
5:20
"I must say this is my fave event of winter olimpc but I don't understand the criteria... I know jumps give points but if you fall how can you still win? On movies that is like the worst thing that could happen so I'm a bit confused 


Now about Yuzuru, I love him he is so elegant and artistic and amazing and young and wow!"
"these commentators had no idea what they were watching, they add such noise and missed all of what he did!"
"Good god the people getting upset about YOI comments are wayyyy more flooding of the comments, detracting from the performance, and annoying than any YOI comment I see. Somehow 'He's so cute' is a perfectly fine comment (that is at the very top and has been for a year) but people mentioning a hugely successful show that was literally using him as the inspiration, isn't? You're all just trying to be gatekeepers and that is the last thing ANY community appreciates."
This makes me think if yuri on ice
♡♥︎
"I'm in pre-Alpha, but I think that Yuzuru is in flipping DELTA. (pre-alpha is 3rd level, Delta is the 7th or 8th level in case if you didn't know.)"
"Gold,"
"I came because the Winter Olympics 2018, but I do like Yuri on Ice."
"So, the female comentarist confused me... she said all time she and the man said he... this guy is awesome, why she (commentarist) keeps refering as ""she"" when talking about him... did I listen incorrectly?"
He was so scared. He has grown since then though
Whooooaaahhh
Ufff. Every single man in that Olympics made mistakes not one clean FS
A música parece acompanhar o corpo
the lack of pooh bears is amazing
but he looked so cute though.
Bruh isn't there a version without the annoying commentators or whatever in the background?
gotta get that anime hero landing at the end
I only know Yuna Kim and Hanyu in figure skating also their trainer (or coach what it is called I don't know) looks the same.
how can the commentators even know the spins he do like I can't differentiate a triple axel to a triple lutz because it looks the same beautiful flying spin to me lol
Look at him so handsome who ever his future wife if you read this You are really lucky to have a talented and handsome husband .
ملكنا
Senpai😍
HE IS 19
👍🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜👏👏👏🌟🌟🌟🎵🎶🎶👑🕺🏻⛸🤴💜💋!!!😭
悔しい金メダルなんて羽生くんにしか言えないね
"He was clearly exhausted. Doing so many routines in one day makes the skaters too tired to control their bodies like usual, and mistakes like this happen. They should have kept the schedule from all the previous Olympics, this one killed all the skaters"
I have to say he was really luck to win the competition with so many mistakes.
I cry a canyon whenever he fall ;-;
Why i always remember yuri on ice when he performs. 😅😅
Красивый костюм
AWWW
I wish there was a version without the announcers' voice-overs. They really detract from the performance -.-
He makes me jealous of Winnie the Pooh.
*a* *n* *i* *m* *e* *!*
after those falls... he still won the gold 2014 winter olympic
"Wow,"
My YURI ON ICE 😍😍😍
I can only think of yuri on ice when i watch this 👁👄👁
i came here after yuri on ice does enyone else ? :D
Why tf the commentator dude criticising him so bad?
이때도 요정같은 옷을 입었었구나
"So, that happened^^ TWICE Olympic Champion~~~~"
why bother with the comments if you can enjoy this whole magestic boy dancing in front of you.. Lol why too salty over Yaoi.
"*not here bc of yuri on ice ... well that's half a lie , i'm here bc of the movie i , tonya :""))*"
Yusuvier is real 7u7r
Where's the Winnie the pooh's? Don't they throw them after his performances?
"I head this an I’m like “huh, that’s the same song Sasha Cohen skated to at the 2006 Olympics... oh, and he fell as well. What a coincidence” 

I’m so angry at myself for thinking that smh."
Can we find footage without narration?
와우! 꽃 미남 왕자님 이시다
"How to make an atheist pray? Make him watch Figure Skating where sportsman falls.
I really prayed"
God why’d they have to make such a crappy anime out of something this beautiful. smh. he did extremely well and his performance was great
why are all these videos unavailable
2022
Here after his performance in 2018. What injury?
"I guess because of the time difference and being more invested in the ice dance competition, but I didn’t remember the win being so precarious and suspenseful. How did the person in silver medal position after short mess up?"
AHHH
I'm dont look up to yuzuru because yuuri from yuri on ice was based off of him (I love that show btw) I just really like how he performs
He reminds me of Victor
"I know yuri on ice bfor yuzuru, bt i never watch it. Some says it's yaoi (i dont really like yaoi) so i skipped it. Bt watching yuzuru skate, makes me want to watch yoi. My mind still fighting wether i'll watch it or not."
Im not very educated on ice skating but id expect top ice skaters to have flawless performances.. how did he win a gold medal after failing a jump like 3 times? Did all other people flop even harder or did he attempt some harder jumps that earned him more points than others who executed easier jumps perfectly?
I want to become his Juliet 😘
Hi Yuzuru xD
Jokes on you im here from death parade 😂
it's the floor's fault that he fell😤
Denis Ten was alive those days
I saw D10 ( Denis Ten) 😢
Anyone know if he will be competing at PyeongChang?
He is my crush :)))
G DRAGON ON ICE!
와 쿼드 진짜 이쁘게뛴다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ한 오십번돌려본듯 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"Yes, a couple falls but Yuzu doesnt do easy."
two falls and olympic gold
Yuri on ice season 2 looks great so far
The commentary drives me nuts. Doesn't do anything for this video. Would be better without it.
He reminded me of yurio when he fell but still got gold 👌💯
Yuri...
My mind is so confused..Is he following the music or the MUSIC is following him
i was scared when he fell at the beginning
My boi yuri in da house
2:18
All the people talking about Yuri on ice. Now i want to watch it to know if Yuzuru is in there or what
What’s the name of the song his skating to
The speaker sounds so bored 😂
Never knew this was part of Yuri on ice before someone commented it
he looks like sehun
개잘한다
Were the falls on purpose I’m confused lol he skates so beautiful though I’m like in love?
I am an ignorant so better I ask: how falling so many times did he win? was he having a much more difficult program than the rest?
He look so NERVOUS
"Can everyone please stop talking about Yuri on Ice on EVERY skating video, especially with Yuzuru Hanyu or Johnny Weir in it? Not only is it insulting to the skater, who wants to be recognized for his or her performance and not some cartoon, but also because you’re just plain *annoying*. You don’t know everything about figure skating just because you watched one season of a poorly animated cartoon about it and you googled what a quad is. Literally all you do is infest comment sections. Go away."
8:42 what... is this how commentators usually are?
I've been skating for 8 years and only landed a quad 4 times😂
Is anyone thinking ' yuri on ice ' ?
how did he got gold ?
woah living yuri
"How come men can pull triple axels so easily? When women do it it's like a HUGE deal?! Not biased, im just curious."
Why am i clapping im by myself in my room...
“No one expected that” after the 4S fall? Really? He didn’t land it all season up to this
is the music from last samurei ?
Do they have some where it is just the music and the ice skating and no commentators
am i the only one who screams a bit every time he trips?
"Yuri on Ice, this guy is 100% Yuri"
"Beautiful skater but he has many sloppy moments..kudos young man, he jumped after fall and gave it his best that day.."
When he fell I got scared af
"oww, its actually normal if you fall down and stand up,now i know.
-beginner"
Ok but I just came back to this video and why am I only noticing now how rude and mean the commentators were? :(
His Biellmann Pirouette is so slow...
"I am not a judge, but how does he win gold if he keep on falling unless the falls are part of his routing."
What's the name of the music he used?
Alguém sabe o nome dessa melodia....?????
"I know pretty much nothing about ice skating; how did he earn gold after falling twice with a ""stumble"" between two jumps?
I can guess these jumps were difficult, but would his competitors simply out value his points with his failings?"
우앙 저렇게 넘어져도 금 주는구나...
Wow mens and women’s figure skating seems so different. It’s pretty much tragic for their score of a female skater falls. Is it because the men’s have more jumps?
Там Денис Тен на первом месте быыл😭😭
That waist
Falls down twice and gets the gold? How bad were the silver and bronze winners?
"I know I'm late, but how did he win gold with so many errors in his jumps?"
You can see how pressured he is right now.
oh no he was nervous <33333333
Por que ele está vestindo blusa feminina? 🙂
Who is Yuri?
His clothes seem beautiful for girls.
Little did those horrible commentators know that he would get gold
I want know the name of music
omg did they base yuri on ice off yuzuru?!
3:26
最喜欢朱罗的鲍步啦😍😍😍
"How do I ask YouTube to include Nathan Chen Special on 2/15 2018Winter Olympics on training. Excellent, better than fabulous!  Why isn’t it already included?!"
"Wait, he fell but he still won gold?"
後半は、きまりました！
Wait from the comments is yuri really inspired my yuzuru?
I'm just over here cringing over the commentator's pronunciation of his name -_- YooZOOroo HAAANyoo
What is a youth?
"I'm sorry, I'm always waiting for him to fall .. I don't know why it makes me tremble even more, I feel like I want to help then hug him"
Vine por el talento de Yuzuru no por el dibujito del que tanto hablan :v
I kind of hate the commenters?
Whats her dialect/accent? does somebody know?
Denizzzz💔
What's wrong with commentary lmao
"I think, they need to clean the ice..."
"He is more subtle, soft, like the wind, i think this music is to harsh for him, did he pick it??!"
can i keep him
how did he win with so many falls?
Why he wasn't happy when he came out first?
I don't like the people who r talking in the background he's amazing but the guy sounds a little snarcky...😾
I'm sorry but his outfit reminded me of Yurio's costume when he did in regards to love: Agape
"I'm honestly pretty annoyed with the people saying ""AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE BECAUSE OF YUZURU AND NOT YURI ON ICE?"" I haven't even seen any comment about yuri on ice but I've seen several comments saying the am I the only one here thing. Like can we please just enjoy Yuzuru's incredible skating??"
Aw see how sad he is :(
how did he get a gold with falling twice?
"Why he is not happy? I don't speak english very well, help 😣"
Wait he’s from Canada.... would he be down to smoke a joint with me o.o
He was so thin during this time... :(
please change the thumbnail.
How did he win a gold medal if he slipped up?
Soo.....am I the only one that thinks yuri!! On ice is about him?
ほ、自動再生するといいですね
I think the commentators just get dumbstruck at times.
YURI IS REALLLLLL
How old is he?
Yuri on ice anyone XD
For all those yuri on ice fans he has a Russian skater friend too. ;)
"and that's how ""Yuri on Ice"" was formed"
"ako nga paikutin lang ng mabagal ng apat na beses nahihilo nako, sya pa kaya na ang haba haba ng spin kineme tas may jumps pa HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH"
He fell 2xs and still win gold?! How bad was the competition? He deserved it in Peyongchang though. I loved all the flying pooh bears after the performance.
He is only 19?!
Can the commentary lady be any more monotone? Lol
How'd he win gold if he went down on the quadruple Salchow?
Is this JANE father?
Lancelot
Sad fall
2연패 이야기해서 누군가 보는데 완벽한 연기를 못하고 금메달   여자경기는 잘하고 은메달 받은이유도 이런 경우 일까요?  ㅎㅎ
И за это золото Олимпиады? Чемпион должен кататься безупречно!
*whispers* wheres the Russian dude
Anyone here for that Yuri On Ice Vibe?
He's fall same Sasha Cohen 2006 😢
"Выиграл с двумя падениями. Непонятно, почему тогда к девочкам претензии из-за того, что они часто становятся победителями или призерами с падениями? Один из примеров - последний ЧМ."
Yuri
😰😯😚
Does he remind anyone else of Yuri?
Yuri on ice
Yuzu made me watch Yuri on Ice
is anyone else screaming at the stupid comentators?
único latino....xd
"""not a great landing though"" ahahahahah he won gold"
"А у него случайно нет молодого тренера из России, в которого он влюблен, ммм?"
He fell twice but he still won gold medal? I don't understand ...
Soobin is that you..no
"Have 1444 people unlike Yuzuru Hanyu get gold medal😢
I think those people are from China 
Hahaha I guess..."
Yuuri is that you?
この時は2回転んでも金なのか。今とはレベルが違ったのかな。
How the heck did this won gold? What a hot mess.
"Ya know, it used to be 80% Yuri!!! On ICE comments, but now, it's 80% of people *about* all the Yuri!!! On ICE comments."
わ、若い…
The announcers are so annoying
these commentators are seriously the worst.
19 YEAR OLD???
im no expert on ice skating but how did this win gold? he messed up so many jumps...
"everyone keeps saying ""he"" ""his"" ""him""?  I dont get it."
The casters were just too annoying
can i marry him....
This won? Hmmm he was great this year but I thing Jason was much better this year. Sorry the typo lol
I can't be the only one that was watching yuzuru before 'yuri on ice' right? It just kinda freaks me out that it's so weirdly based on them :/
"two jump errors, did he won ?"
"Honestly, he looks like RM (namjoon)"
"Tiene mas cintura y pecho que yo :""'v 7u7"
How can he win.... He fell down 2x
His top is a woman's wear
"I'm confused, can someone explain to me how he won the gold medal even though he fell multiple times?"
He is a great skater...amazing but the top is awful honestly.
My real life Yuri
Freaking commentators are so annoying ugh
"i disliked sochi olympics. apart from the robbery kim yuna’s gold, the crowd didn’t have a good sportsmanship... the way the shouted “russia” whenever a foreign athlete performs.... whew."
How do you fall over twice and get gold?!
Sagittarius af’
"Although hes talented, I guess the girls choreo are better to watch (ive been bingeing on yuna kim clips)"
"Yuri?! Is that you?
2018 anyone?"
i'm not an expert here... but he fell twice and still won gold... are the other competitors that bad???
The commentary pisses me of...
Todo es perfecto pero porque tiene que vestir tan femenino???
The next Yuna Kim
А почему он в женской блузке??? Сейчас лучше катают.
Ummm... Just looking for some Yuri on ice look a like :D
Just watched Yuri on ice
I hate so much those animators 🙄
I rlly hate these narrators
"金メダルおめでとう㊗️なんですが…
今見返すと…演目違ってもよかったかもね。
ショートとフリーの組み合わせ…めちゃくちゃ討論していると思うけど…
音楽かなぁ…響かない。
難しいものですね😓"
This music is a curse for first jumps in a program.
the amount of people who are only on here bc of a stupid anime is actually disgusting.
Yuri on ice beats everybody
Woman's shirt
How he get gold? He fell twice!
Oh Yuri on Ice look at what you’ve done to me
I hate the commentatorssss
"The unequaled lily bacteriologically guarantee because shade infrequently waste toward a bewildered evening. cluttered, noisy egg"
"The long harbor intermittently repair because mine endoscopically squeeze behind a curvy turnip. private, rapid colon"
He needs more manly costumes.
Figure skating admires attempt not mere success...
yuri on ice gtfo
That was man?
"Yo he isnt like that other japanese skater sure, but like oof he still can do it later"
とと
喜欢美女吗。。。。。r9)
So under-rotation on the quad axel and another minor dodgy landings. He finished well and his first round world record kept him in front? Maybe someone else had a cleaner 2ndc run score?
Qatars
А мне не нравится лёд .. 🤔что то не то .. не чистый какой то .. 🫤
No me gusta tu playera te vistieron como niña
"И все таки сумасшествие и страстность Плющенко мне намного больше нравится, и миру тоже. И разнообразие и сложнып элементы и рост Плющенко. Плющенко очень хорошо смотрится на льду."
And people were giving Johnny Weir a hard time?? This dude is more feminine....by far!!
P
how can he win after mistakes...
Hes not even good
Rússia don't robbed here!
he has a really feminine body lol
2 falls and got a gold medal?
I don’t know much about figure skating but he has great energy and figure... but he messed up SO many times... how was this the gold metal performance..?
"He wears such frumpish tops, what's up with that?   Great skating, but he was  better in 2018."
From the top i though it was the woman competition
słabe wyjebał się i złoto hahahha a co z bródką kur wa
Weakest men's gold medal free skate in Olympic history.  And then Chan bombed even worse.
Is this girl or guy?
this guy falling twice and landing badly on most of his jumps and still winning gold medal is probably the most Yuri thing he has ever experienced 😂
"LoL this is absolutely far from perfect. ISU should revamp their critera, landing is a key part in jumps as well as perfection. Most of the jumps are awful."
"I can't understand what it's the hype about him, yeah sure he is good, but not such great as many thinks they're. Even some people compares him with Plushenko. Plushenko NEVER falls down like that in an Olympic's games."
"It says men's figure skating, but I only see a cute girl."
So many falls and he still won gold? I dont know anything about scoring but I feel like that wouldve ruined his chances at gold at least
Boo!
"Два падения и Чемпион, Трусова 5 квадов и серебро! Судьи как хотят так и вертят… буууууууу"
позор
He fell... a lot...
"Average at best, not worthy of a gold medal from this performance alone."
"This is awful, he fell 2x - he won gold from this?"
"He won the gold? At the beginning he failed and won? So, the others have to be terribledkaters?"
"Don't attempt jumps if you can't pull them off. He should have received huge deductions for them. He wasn't ready for the big jumps but he squeezed them in. So it's how many big jumps you can squeeze in now, is it? Ruining figure skating. Denis Ten should have won gold. Clean jumps. No falls. Japan stole Kazakhstan's gold."
He fell lol he deserves bronze
"Не нравятся женские кофточки на парне,как он мог натянуть женскую кофточку ,заставили? Или он сам настолько увлечен и не понимает, что из него делают девочку?"
気持ち悪い男らしくない
"I don't see artistry here, what, is he supposed to be a Romeo? And um...Olympic champions don't fall, or at least i thought they don't, but I see it changed. I see no artistry in male figure skating since Yagudin left ice in 2003 and it's very sad, where is my figure skating which is artistry, and not just jumps? Where is art, where are emotions =/ The last time I saw real art was Medvedeva's Memoirs of geisha =("
"His skating does absolutely nothing for me. Plushenko would have won hands down. Unfortunately, he had to withdraw for medical reason."
Nah
Look like a skinny girl. Bad costume choice
"like pop music the quality of ice skating gets worse too. such a shame: gold metal when you kiss the floor ( I respect his determination though, but he shouldn't get the gold)"
Nathan Chen could be better
Most overrated skater. Rarely skated clean programs
