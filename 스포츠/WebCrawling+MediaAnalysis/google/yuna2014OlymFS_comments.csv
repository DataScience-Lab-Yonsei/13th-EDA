She was not crying not to get gold medal. She cried just because it was her last official performance. She is already beyond gold medal.
6 years later and I'm still bitter about her not winning gold....
her silver shines more than gold.
9 years and still bitter that she didn't win the gold. At least we all know who really deserved it... I get chills watching any performance of hers.
Yuna doesn’t need a medal. SHE NEEDS A DIAMOND CROWN
This is the true gold medalist.
"Is there anyone watching in 2020?
+) The new year begins with Yuna again!"
She did not protest of scores because she knows that she is the true champion. Kim Yun A is a champion of 2014 olympics
It’s officially 2019 and I’m still not over this
"did you guys know she never even complained once about this event (well, any other event in her life)? she said ""i'm not the judge, so i cannot say anything about the result"" she is so humble and she even gave sotnikova a hug after the event, even though sotnikova only held out her hands for a handshake."
"A female American commentator called this ""a performance for the ages."" Looking back, I'm thankful she didn't call this a gold medal winning routine. Gold medal-winning performances can be surpassed. But being called ""performance for the ages"" means being put on a level much higher than a gold medal."
How can the ending be so perfectly matching to the music? She’s a legend!
"4 years have passed and I still get mad, this is the worst judgement ever"
"She had both the artistic and technical prowess. A gold standard in figure skating, even 8 years later"
8 years later and I’m still bitter about her not winning gold ……
"a whole decade later, still crystal clear that yuna kim shouldve been gold. she skated with such grace and elegance, landing her jumps clean, and somehow got beaten by an unknown girl who skated like a stick and landed her jump with two feet. ridiculous."
"Yuna, your silver will shine as gold forever! You were the best by far!"
"2022, I’m still here to watch this performance. You can’t get over her performances. The queen."
"This is an olympic program, not because it was skated at the Olympics, but because it achieved something that every skater hopes to achieve: at each moment it felt like an Exhibition skate. It was free, it was sensual, it was poignant, but above all, it was real. She wasn't pretending for the judges, and she wasn't constantly thinking about rotation and transitions and the stuff of junior skaters. 
She skated like a woman who has nothing to prove, and that is why, she is Queen Yuna."
"At the moment I thought she was robbed, with Sotnikova becoming the gold medalist. But now, everyone knows Yuna is a true winner. Her performances in Vancouver and Sochi was just glorious and I don't even remember what songs Sotnikova used for the program."
"Her jumps are perfect, but her level of musicality and artistry are on another level. I think thats the reason people love her. Its not just jumping like super mario bros, she really connects with the song. In her performances music is not just BGM, its actually part of the act. Its like watching ballet on ice."
"She makes a double axel look like it's nothing more than childs play. She is so amazing and you can tell she has taken plenty of ballet classes and dance classes. Everything from her posture, to movements, to hand gestures, it is ALL fluid and in scync. A truly amazing skater."
she is a two-time olympic champion
THE TRUE 2014 OLYMPIC CHAMPION. Yuna has nerves of steel.
Some young figure skaters (ladies) nowadays should really learn how to jump technically correct like Yuna instead of doing quadruple jumps with bad techniques... Yuna is so pleasing to watch. And her jumps are effortless.
"It is not just figure skating. 
It is an art. 
Yuna Kim is the best ever"
"실제 저때 메달도 못 받을수 있겠다 싶을 만큼 분위기가 개 험악했다는데 그 모든 압박감을 견뎌내고 올 클린하고, 부정심사에도 웃으면서 우아함을 잃지 않았다...당시에는 화내지 않는 연아가 이해가지 않았는데 지금보니 화내고 제소해도 결과는 달라지지 않았을 것 같아서, 침착하게 웃으면서 자신의 은퇴경기 마무리하는 김연아가 참 대단하다"
10 Years later and still not over this!! Her progam was DIVINE! True gold medalist. 🏅
"I'm Russian and I'm always happy when my country wins but I really wanted Yuna to get gold. I was almost crying after the performance. Perfect dress, perfect programme, such an elegant music and skating. I stand for justice"
"She is perfect. She should have taken the gold, cause she was the real winner that time. 
I'm Russian and I want to apologize  to all Koreans for Sotnikova's gold medal."
Yuna is the real gold medalist.
"10 years later, she's still  'The Queen'."
"She deserves a diamond, not a gold. Super awesome."
2018 and I still think deserved her second Olympic gold medal.
I'm NOT a Korean.  But YUNA KIM is the REAL GOLD WINNER!!!  It's already 2018 and I can't stop watching her...
당시 어렸던 나는 김연아 마지막 올리픽에서 편파판정으로 금메달을 따지 못한거에 분하고 눈물났는데 나이들고 다시 보니까 분한것 보다도 김연아가 무슨 마음으로 경기에 임했을지를 더 생각하게 되는 거 같다. 승부보다 다른 가치가 더 크다는 것. 그녀에게 메달 색은 중요치 않다는 것. 본인의 방식대로 아름답게 마무리한 것. 선수생활 하는 내내 수없이 많은 편파판정과 부상에 누구보다 억울하고 힘들었을텐데 견디고 이겨내서 멋지게 은퇴 할 수 있다니 진정한 스케이터고 스포츠정신이고 어른이 아닐까.. 나뿐만 아니라 많은 사람들이 다시 보러 오고 기억하는게 진정한 가치인 거 같다.
I am Russian by blood and disgusted with the rigged scoring. There is no doubt Yuna should have won. This event was such a disgrace.
"I think the most amazing thing in Yuna's skating is emotion. It's not just about techniques. She has amazing sense of music and dance and knows how to express it. Can't help falling into her performance. If I were the judge, I would give her about 798908547398203948750points for component score"
SHAME ON THE JUDGES. SHAME ON THE ISU. YUNA DESERVED THE GOLD
"I just can't imagine how strong she must be mentally to do this skate. Let's see: she skates under tremendous pressure from her home country when she didn't want to return, esp due to how broken her body was from all the accumulated injuries... She skated in front of a hostile crowd, while knowing the judges are against her... She was placed last, in the worst position... She already saw how inflated sotnikovas scores were, which must be discouraging... And she knows this is her swan song, her last skate before she retires and says goodbye to the sport that's been a part of her life for so long. I think it's practically a miracle she skated so well, her last gift to the world, a gift of absolute beauty and artistry. She's a huge part of skating history, that's for sure."
"I don't care about the Russian, nobody remembers her. Yuna Kim is the true legend"
"Yuna was the last to skate. Can you imagine the pressure she felt in this performance, knowing that Sotnikova's scores were so ridiculously inflated that unless she skated at her very best, and even possibly then, chances were she wouldn't make it?

This performance is breathtaking. It isn't even the best of Yuna's career, but it's the one I always come back to. The world will never see a female skater as complete as Yuna Kim."
"After all this time, I still wondered why she couldn't get the gold. But then I realized she was a diamond. A diamond that doesn't need to be represented by a gold medal. She will forever be the Queen that had graced upon the field of ice."
True Olympic champion. And everyone knows that.
When the silver shines brighter than the gold. Queen Yuna. A legend.
"4:33 ""Ah, The Queen."" straight up goose bumps"
"After watching the performances in Beijing winter olympic, I ended up coming back to this performance. No one can perform so beautifully and with full of elegance like Yuna."
"Kim Yuna - the pinnacle of a woman’s skating: grace, technique, skating skills, artistry….and charisma."
"""the queen"" yes, exactly"
"It’s literally  2021, and I’m mad.
For me, of all her competing performances, THIS IS THE BEST. 
Very elegant, it’s as if she was performing for theatre and not olympics."
"Everyone knows the truth.
She's the true gold medalist, the two-time Olympic champion."
"wow Yuna was perfect, her program was artistic, her moves were so gentle, she did everything so clean! she deserves gold medal… I can’t believe Sotnikova almost fall during her performance…how is it possible? so unfair"
"just here after watching the Beijing Olympics, but absolutely she's still the best figure skater ever..."
"The most elegant, sophisticated yet understated performance delivered by Queen Yuna. In other words, both of her performances were ""technically and artistically"" unsurpassable.not only in Sochi but in the history of figure skating. ISU, you just don't know what you have ruined."
She deserved gold for this.
Yuna Kim is such a star! She is so emotional when she skates. All her moves are as if she was floating on the ices.Such a wonderful skater
"Four years later, I still think her performance was the best of the night.  A memorable silver medal, and I don‘t even remember who won the gold.  Just wonderful!"
It's like I'm watching water. She moves so gracefully I am so shocked she got 2nd place.
"Shes like water. So so so elegant, flowy, mesmerizing"
모든 구성이 끊기지 않고 물처럼 흐르는 느낌...점프를 연기 속에 자연스럽게 녹여내는 유일한 선수. 연아는 예술 그 자체야.
She deserves a diamond medal!
"I don't care how many quads girls can do nowadays, I still think Yuna is the best🥰
This program was perfect."
"Here is in 2088, everyone still says “Yuna deserves it"""
"I’m Russian, but I also undoubtedly can say, that she is a true winner, Sotnikova skates like a wooden stick"
"개최국이랍시고 억지로 메달을 가져가는거보다 정당한 주인에게 주었다면 러시아와 소치올림픽이 더 자랑스러웠을텐데
러시아는 참 아쉬운 선택을 했죠. 이때를 기억하는 거의 대부분의 사람들이 소트니코바를 금메달의 주인으로 인식하지 않습니다."
"Yuna Kim's performances will forever be the goddess standard in figure skating. No gold medals awarded by crooked judges or won through the use of performance-enhancing drugs by 'successors' of Yuna Kim, will change this fact."
"This is so beautiful, from the beginning to the end (especially the end). Hard to believe she didn't get gold"
Never tire of watching this classic athlete…..her style and grace are unmatched…
"경기 직후였나. ""부당한 점수가 나올것은 분위기나 다른것들로 충분히 예상할 수 있었다""고 연아는 말했다.
Perhaps right after the game, Yuna said ""The unfair score was predictable enough for the atmosphere and other things."" 

이후 자서전에서 그녀는 이처럼 말한다
After that, she said in her autobiograhy

"" 내가 부당한 점수때문에 흔들려서 스케이팅을 망쳤다면, 그것이야말로 나 스스로에게 지는 결과가 아니었을까. 
""If I was shaken by an unfair score and ruined the skating,
that is the result losing to myself.

나에게 닥친 시련을 내가 극복하지 못했다면, 
결국 내가 패하기를 바라는 어떤 힘에 스스로 무릎꿇는 결과가 되지 않았을까.
If I had not overcome the ordeal, 
it would have resulted that surrendered myself to the force that I hope to fail.

하지만 나는 지지 않았다. ""
But I didn't lose."""
"if i see kim yuna in person i would tell her, ''i know you, you won gold on the 2010 & 2014 olympics.''"
"Yuna deserves a gold medal. This is absolutely stunning, perfect."
Even her fingertips flow with the music and she hits every pose spot on with the music. Very graceful and perfect harmony with the music. Her performance could not have been any better. Olympics judges just want one of their own to get gold. It should've been appealed
"Russians.....Even though they gave Yuna a silver, I truly believe in my heart that the best women figure skater in history is Yuna and it's not close. Her step sequence and gestures are what I like about her. Not only she has top techniques but also, her artistry is the best in history. You may argue there are better jumpers than her, but no one has better expression to the music than this woman..including men."
How did this amazing performance get silver and not the gold? I watched the other girls and it wasn't half as detailed and graceful as this....
"I haven't seen the performance like this. This is amazing, gorgeous, and beautiful. She is real gold medalist. No doubt."
"When I watch her skate she makes me cry. So much passion,art, joy, class, skill in her skating and it just takes my breath away."
"“Adios Nonino is a very dynamic and strong piece of music. Yuna’s arrangement of this piece is the one that I have kept since I first started working as a choreographer. The music is full of emotions and yet has cheerfulness within its captivating powers. It is a difficult piece to express because the music suddenly changes from strong and dramatic to subtle and nostalgic. Only Yuna can express it.""  — David Wison
“It was my last competition, and it was a long, hard journey to be there. I was just so happy to finish it.” “More than being remembered as the Vancouver gold medalist or the Sochi silver medalist, I just want people to remember that there was once a skater named Yuna Kim. ”"
"Unfair GOEs for Yuna Kim. She got too underrated scores with flawless performance...., while russian skater got overrated scores with several mistakes..."
this is gold this is not silver this is diamond
"The last emperor of figure skating.
One of the greatest program that skated with the music so insanely well"
Only one word perfectly describes her: Queen.
온몸에 전율이 느켜지는 스케이터는 아직까지 김연아 단 한사람뿐이다. 아무리 점수가 높은 경기를 봐도 그어떤 전율도 느끼지 못했다.
never seen a silver that is brighter than the gold and a gold that is dirtier than the silver
"Look at her skating movement, techniques and choreography. these are the best in this world. Anyone can’t break this champion."
I'm Russian and I'm sure that she must be a champion. I'm sorry. We still watch this wonderful program and love it.
Her technique and artistry is out of this world
"Russians shouted Russia! before and after her performances. They even tried to shout before she tried her jumps during her performances. They were too rude. Yuna was able to overcome this bad situation with her strong metality. Even though she got silver, fans from all over the world know Yuna was true gold medalist. Cheer up Yuna! and I'm thank you for your great performances. Russians, learn good manners first before international competitions."
"I mean......nobody can skated this kind of music with under so much pressure like her

This is the best musicality ever for women individual skating

She's the toughest performer"
I haven't seen another skater feel the music as much as Yuna kim
"Not only Yuna’s  free skate, also her short program was SO MUCH UNDERRATED."
"She is not skating.


She married to the music while dancing on the ice"
"Yuna Kim for me is the greatest musician for single skaters ever.

She is real dancer and actress on the ice who know how to express emotional to match the tone of the music better  than anyone."
"It seems like Yuna is from different planet where figure skating is an art piece. Her performance exists at a different level from other skaters. She is always truly immersed in the music, emotion, and character and looking like nothing matters than achieving her high excellence. She also has whole packages: power, speed, accuracy, elegance, and expressiveness. 
She deserved more than a gold medal, maybe a platinum one. I am very thankful to witness Yuna’s performance, because I know that this kind of perfection is something happening once in the figure skating. She will be missed whenever I watch other skaters skate but never reach her level, never make me moved to tears. Sotnikova is also a good skater with powerful skills. However, she will be remembered as a questionable medalist while Yuna remembered as a true champion in history."
"Katharina Witt, a 2 times gold champion winner, said herself that she was extremely shocked after this incident...  after Yuna's performance she said to herself quote ""I was already thinking oh yes, welcome to the club of 2 times gold, my friend and when i saw the score of Sotnikova I was in shock."" Man..... Russian Olympic judges in women's figure skating really were trying everything huh.... what a shame"
"Yuna is the reason why I love watching ice skating. She's not ice skating, she's dancing on the ice"
"I'm continuing to watch over and over this gold performance and I can't still get rid of the rage for what happened that time during Sochi Olympics. This free state was absolutely gorgeous, from passion to drama, only Yuna could master a difficult music choice like that. Wow, I feel so strange even eight years after this tragedy. Not just a skater, but a true artist. She will be a legend forever, eternal. Thank you Yuna for such strong emotions and for this journey with you. I miss you so much! There will not be another athlete like you."
"yuna has the skills
has the looks
has the emotions
has the rythym and beat
has the power in her movements
has the elegance
the whole performance flows so smoothly
so many reasons why she should have won"
"In a skating world, where competitors only focuses and anticipate their next spin and jump, we have Kim Yuna who swiftly and elegantly dances to the music. The technical parts are just a bonus."
She is a winner and champion and legend. Nobody can take that from her. And the world knows that.
10 years later and still a champion. Forever my favorite skater. I love how she has strength but still so beautiful on the ice and makes it look elegant.
"just unable to stop my tears, this is the greatest performance in Olympic history. i never get tired of watching this breathtaking performance."
Man they should give her a diamond not a silver
"here in 2022, still such a legendary performance"
"This is once in a lifetime musical performance in history of single skating

not only her artistic miracle but her edge quality ,speed across the ice , jump technique is insane level"
연아 미소가 마치 이렇게 될 줄 알고 있었다는 것 같아서 너무 슬프다...그래도 영원히 연아는 퀸이고 나에게 피겨 스케이팅이라는 것이 이렇게 매력적인 것이라는 것을 일깨워주어서 너무 고맙고 영광스러운 존재다.
"Did nobody realize that Sotnikova just ran straight to hug one of the judges when her gold medal was announced? Smh.... I mean if you are going to cheat, at least don't make it so obvious...."
"I'm still campaigning for her gold, Olympic. I wouldn't mind a surprise announcement of late trophy awarding in Pyeongchang for this lady."
Finally! I've been waiting for this day for almost three years! Congratulations on 10 million views! Let's go for 20 million!
"Absolutely nothing ""silver"" about this performance. Gold, platinum, rubies and black diamonds. Yuna is the ultimate."
"she is amazing. It doesn't matter what Russians say. She is my ice queen. Yuna Kim has been my light in the darkness. If she could gracefully in the face of disappointment, I can get by in any situation as well. She taught me discipline, perseverance and resilience. She is simply wonderful, as an ice skater and as a person. Long live my Queen."
"Not silver, This is only Gold."
8 years on and I still think Yuna deserved the gold. She’s the rightful champion and will always be the legend and queen of figure skating who touched so many hearts and inspired so many
True winner. I’m so sorry for my native country took away your deserved gold((
I'm late to the party but... this is just stunning. you can see the emotion and the story through her performance
"이경기 직관했으면 진짜 울었을듯
마지막 경기라 그런지 메달을 초월한 뭔가를 보여줌...."
"gold-worthy performance, clean techniques, musicality, grace, THE QUEEN. No one can change my mind. I wish in the next olympics another skater worthy like her would win. And I hope skating fans nowadays won't be brainwashed by putting difficulty more rather than an eye-catching performance that is more worthy to watch."
She is the real QUEEN still 2020. No one can follow her LOL.
"Whenever feel vulnerable, tend to watch yuna's performances. It really helps a lot everytime.   At that time Yuna's attitude for every dirty plays of other skaters while pre-warm up session just before playing performances and judges's unfair points was so rare and so admirable. I sincerely adore her and admire her spirit. It is so valuable"
"It's 2020 and I'm still not over it... hopefully somewhere in the future Russia gets a lawsuit and will be forced to give Yuna her gold back ... and that 'judge' who hugged Sotnikova after she robbed Yuna, she still works in ISU as a judge.. Shame on Russia.. Shame on ISU.. 
Yuna is 2 TIME OLYMPIC CHAMPION"
This is a masterpiece!! still makes me cry. Long live the Queen Yuna !! 👑👑
"2 years past, but I still cry while watching this great masterpiece. Yuna Kim is the one and only skater."
"WTF? HOW COME SHE ONLY GOT SILVER? 

It seriously deserves a gold. This was better than that other girl... Sotnivoka was it?"
Yuna Kim is such a humble artist who is humble in victory as well as defeat and her impact is so ingrained as a figure queen. She undoubtedly deserved the gold.
Yuna kim is the true legend. She is the best female figure skater in history. This is the true gold medalist🥇The Queen...
I am Russian yet I still don’t understand how Sotnikova could win over THAT perfomance!… really the Queen Yuna Kim
I love how Yuna's Silver medal performance has 1 million more views than Sotnikova's gold.
She made it look sooo easy.... Amazing performance by the Queen.
"점프는 말할것도 없지만
스텝 봐라 ㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 현란함과 안정감과 황홀함이 섞여져 있음 진짜 대단한 선수다 
진짜 저런 선수 없다"
goosebumps. i really hope that she occasionally reads the comments on her performances so she is aware that we all know who the true gold medalist is!
"As Yuna's fan I did not even dare to watch this video again...Still it is heartbreaking to watch her perfect performance and the unfair judgent..Kim Yuna, definitely you are the BEST.You are the true champion."
"This young lady was and will always be the best of this era. I have no doubt that little girls are looking up to her, not the other girl how got the gold."
"The strongest performer I've ever seen in women skating.

Yuna Kim is define of perfect technician and incredible musicality with expressiveness"
"She is still my number one, and real champion in sochi. Gold medal is yuna’s. absolutely"
what silver? this is GOLD
2014 Sochi Olympic gold medalist Yuna Kim's wonderful performance
The true winner always wins the heart.... 2024 and still watch this excellent performance
Cheating on a good person is like throwing away a diamond and picking up a rock; She should be a gold medalist.
We all know who deserved gold...
This should be the GOLD. Beautiful!!
The queen of figure skating. She is a legend. We still remember that she is a true champion.
Who else is watching this in 2019?
I miss her. Still the best in the world.
greatest female figure skater of all time.
"She's  the class of her own.   she's diamond 

so elegance , sophisticated dancer, very on time to the music , speed across the ice , exquisite jumping technique , edge quality , commanding performer infront of russian crowd"
She deserves a gold but it doesn't matter silver is stronger than gold so
"im from Russia and now I think Yuna Kim is the QUEEN. R E A L QUEEN. she's pretty beautiful stunning super talented precious wonderful lovely magnificent gorgeous etc. but the saddest thing is that i didn't understand this in 2014, but I knew that Sotnikova didn't deserve the gold too. 
and disappointed in judges too ofc. they're so incompetent. "
"Sotnikova : wrong edge
Yuna : wrong judge"
"This performance is age like fine wine , get better and better with time pass. Timeless performance

Unbeliveable the level of artistry choreography and musicality  !!! She is the music"
웃긴게 연아 점프 높이 낮아보이게 하려고 연아 경기할때 카메라 구도를 바꿈 ㅋㅋㅋ NBC버전으로 보면 연아 점프높이 올라가 있음. NBC카메라가 맞는거임. 올림픽 영상은 연아 경기때만 구도를 바꿨음. 게다가 연아 경기 끝나고 화동이 박수치려고 손 올리니까 옆에 있던 관계자가 박수 못치게 막음. 완전 짜고치는판.....
"There isn't a note in this program that is looked over, this is the most detailed and fused to the music of any singles program ever, with extremely difficult music. Notice at 1:16 how her arm comes off her hip right as the final note ""releases"" the musical phrase. At 3:23 the timing of the steps and the jump are matched to the deep piano chords, and the rotations of the Salchow are augmented by the rapid motion of the accordion. In her choreographic sequence at 4:00 each leg movement is perfectly synced with the accented chords. These are just some of the small details that make this is my favorite LP of hers. Her Sochi programs were her way of saying goodbye to her skating career, and looking back at all the hardship as well as the joy. I wonder if Adios Nonino was specifically chosen because of how she could not see her father for extremely long periods of time because of how her career and family life was designed. It is so rare to see a truly passionate piece like this in skating. Thank you Yuna, and everyone who helped make her career possible."
"This brought me to tears. It’s honestly so so amazing, she’s truly talented and belongs on the ice. She totally deserved gold! 

I aspire to be equally as passionate about something someday"
"For some reason, Yuna`s modest dress (compared to some typical ice skaters' outfits) is just so beyond beautiful and helps to deliver the performance of a lifetime. What a great clean technique!"
Yuna is just perfect and she is another level from Sotnikova.
"Shame on my native country, Yuna is the real winner of this Olimpic games."
"다들 알잖아요
은메달리스트가 아니라 금메달리스트인 거"
I’m russian and I’m still embarrassed that my country stole the olympic gold from the queen herself. And Carolina deserved a silver medal with her stunning performances. Both of them are legends who were robbed💔
Superb performance!  She should have won the gold medal.  Totally outclassed the others.  
자기토바 쇼트보고 생각나서 왔습니다. 김연아는 음악을 위해 춤을 추고 자기토바(를 비롯해 요즘 선수들)는 점수를 위해 춤을 추네요... '진짜' 피겨스케이팅이 그립습니다.
"관중 매너 진짜 지금봐도 최악이다;;;;
 물론 어느나라든 자국 선수들을 유독 아끼긴 하지만..  이때는 정말 러시아의 밑바닥을 보는 것 같았다.  
그리고 김연아 선수가 클린연기를 선보이고 난 후에 심판진들의 표정이 썩 좋아 보이지도 않았고..
원래 이러는 건가 싶기도 하지만 꼭 이거 아니어도 소치올림픽은 여러모로 답이 안나온다.."
"NEVER MOVE-ON! After 10 Years, KIM YUNA's PERFORMANCE was ICONIC and LEGEND than the RUSSIA who won GOLD.  👏👏"
"For me personally this is an excellent display of the STRENGTH of a woman. Mental and physical strength, the poise, grace and elegance, passion and beauty of only one young woman will always remain in history books. Love you my inspirational queen."
"The commentator said it at the end: ""The queen!"" And I feel like crying. Again. This was so unfair! They robbed her of her deserved 2nd gold medal. 😭😡"
6 years later and I am still not over this robbery
"Who can skate a tango like this especially for Long Program? No one. Yuna was the winner of the night for sure. Skating skills, Transitions, Interpretation, Choreography, Musicality. My scoring = 10 of 10."
"It never fails. When I see this performance... I want to cry... Every. Single. Time. It's so amazing... Yuna Kim, you're the queen and you will remain the queen... Thank you so so so much for your passion, all your hard work, and for giving us this beautiful gift: this one-of-a-kind breathtaking performance..."
Boy I miss her. Women's skating hasn't been the same without her sigh
"It's edge of 2016, but can't stop watching this. miss her so much, we figure skate fans will never forget you, queen. still very angry about her silver. #YunaIsOurWinner"
너무 억울하고 속상해서 그동안 보지 못했던 영상인데... 이젠 그리워서 보게되네요...
I probably watched this at least twenty times in a week. Hail the Queen. The gold is yours forever. 
"Her performance is so much better... ;_; 
yuna is winner of hearts!!!"
Russia should never host olympics again. what a shame on their judgement and rude manners
its 2023 and i still come back to watch what i believe is the gold standard for woman's figure skating
"4 Years have passed since the Sochi Olympic and Yuna has been working  as the ambassador of Unicef, Pyeongchang Olympic, Lillehammer Youth Olympic being entitled as the honorary sport athlete worldwide. I’m so proud of her"
"amazing performance absolutely stunning,  deserves GOLD... she is trully art, 
God bless Yuna Kim"
"The complexity of her step sequence was out of the world, and yet she executed it with such smoothness and such precision in time with the music is absolutely amazing."
2022년 올림픽을 보고나서도 이거 보면 너무 신기함ㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 어떻게 한걸까? 8년이 지난 지금에도 설명이 안됨.. 어떻게 점프를 제일 완벽하게 잘 뛰었던 선수가 스케이팅 스킬까지 저럴 수가 있었을까?? 기술성과 예술성 전부 탑이었고 아직까지도 소환돼서 퀸으로 불린다는 사실이 경이로움
"Hurts my heart to watch this. A pioneer of the sport, a pure technician who’s wrecked her body countless times for the sake of her passion and responsibility as a Korean, an ingenious prodigy whose achievements are forever unmatched, a natural-born DANCER with such effortless finesse on ice— she did not deserve this conclusion. It goes without saying that the reality of finishing your incomparable career must bring forth tears and sorrowful joy, but she is merely human. Anyone would feel upset if they’d spent that much time producing unprecedented results and having to be mistreated just when it counts most. The fact is that it was never rare for her to be underscored— the predominance of her career has been comprised of just that— but I can’t imagine having to sit there and act like I have not a clue of the judges’ blatant antics and having to smile like it was nothing. It wasn’t nothing. She’s always planned to retire years prior to Sochi, the only reason for her return being the underlying duty of providing other Korean skaters a chance to experience the Olympic Games. I don’t want to continue dwelling on the past. She was, is, and will forever be the transcendent Queen of figure skating."
I m Russian. But I m not happy that Sotnikova  won gold in Sochi 2014. Yuna deserved gold!!!!!!!   What a shame to see unfair sport decision
"i can't accept this....her perfect jumps,her artistry is not matched by any women on the ice ....whatever may be the judgement...Kim Yuna should have been the Olympic Champion of 2014..."
Back here again after ages still wanted to see the “performance for ages”  you’re not forgotten yuna kim
"Queen Yuna, 2 time olympic champion."
"Yuna's ina bauer double axel got only +1 GOE while Adelina's double axel with no entrace and ugly air position got +3 GOE. This, my friend, is why ISU is DEAD"
"This performance always brings me to tears, its so hard to fully enjoy knowing she was wrongly awarded silver. There never has been a skater as amazing as Yuna Kim...Ive been watching the qualifiers for the 2018 games coming up and Im sad that no one can quite match her magic on the ice. I really miss seeing her perform"
Robbed. Robbed her rightful gold by some Russian unknown and everyone knows it.
Everyone knows she’s the World Figure Queen and the True Olympic champion .
"My gawd, she only got silver for this? That performance was very expressive and fantastic! I always thought she was born in the ice and she really fit to this. She's so beautiful and elegant. And the name itself? Yuna = Moon. moon+ice what a combo!"
"8 years later I'm still watching this with tears in my eyes for the beauty. The greatest night of ice skating showing with brutality at the same time what a small country Russia actually is, and how shameful the IOC is versus the original Olympic idea."
ㅋㅋㅋ이렇게 모든 사람이 금메달이라고 인정하는게 너무ㅋㅋㅌ 러시아 진짜 안 쪽팔리냐 나 같으면 금메달 반납하겠다
"Pissed off with the biased commentaries. I know nothing about figure skating but the differences between Kim Yuna's and Adelina Sotnikova's performance is huge. All I hear is praises when I was watching Adelina's performance (even when she made a mistake that's obvious) like ""A little dance step there"" when she stumbled. After Adelina won her ""gold"" medal, she did not win anymore in the later season. 100% rigged, Kim Yuna doesn't need any gold medal, she herself is a treasure."
5:45 when even picking up a teddy bear is elegant asf
2023 and still tears in my eyes.
I honestly think she skated even better than 2010 Vancouver here. Consider everything THEY tried to put her in a bad situation. She was the last skater of the final group and even had to wait for like 4 minutes before her skating while Ashley's score is being suspiciously delayed.
She deserve to be gold medalist.... awesome
She should’ve won gold
"It's been 11 years, and she still didn't get her gold medal she deserved"
"She is the best ice skater in all history, change my mind"
"Its officially 2020, still not over this"
She is definitely a real dancer....Love her movements!
I can’t help but keep coming back to this program. Definitely one of my favourites of hers. This program is a poem that ages so well. So perfect.
step sequence alone is worthy the gold medal !!!  the highest level of musicality
Yuna Kim was simply gorgeous.. She's a real Olympic champion Sochi . I'm from Russia!!!! We love you Kim.
"Not silver or gold, but diamond!"
wow.. that step sequence. hold the edge tight and even release at some points. that makes her flows to look more easy. I love that part and that's the thing that makes her skating the best.
She became one with music. It gives me goosebumps.
가장 마음이 아프고 그녀의 모든 선수생활을 꾹꾹 눌러담은 것 같아 가장 존경스러웠던 무대
Who else is watching in 2018?
I know nothing about figure skating but even I know she deserved gold.
"Nobody can compare or near her musicality......this is the best artistry musicality ever in women single skating

If russian girl won Gold medal, this performance is Diamond medal"
"Commentators : “I’ve got funny feelings that Sotnikova is gonna win” 

Well it is funny indeed. That was the joke. An average skater somehow beats the best skater. What a joke."
So where was Sotnikova after getting Gold medal? Did she appear any major competitions? No. It proves that she was not the person who deserved gold color at Sochi. Russia ruined not only the pure spirit of Olympic but also Yuna’s last performance.
What a travesty. She deserved the gold without a doubt.
10 years later and I'm still so sad for her. She should've won gold.
David wilson her choreographer said only Yuna Kim can pull this program off
"For the benefit of all confused writers on this topic as well as for the general public let me clarify once and for all the facts concerning the scoring and show why Yuna Kim should have won gold. I will only address the scoring for the free program, although the scoring for the short program was also highly dubious and has attracted a lot of criticism.

As is common knowledge, the free program score for each skater is the sum of their TES (technical element score) and their PCS (program component score), the two scores carrying roughly equal weight. The TES in turn is the sum of the base difficulty value for each of the twelve technical elements, e.g. a triple Lutz and the corresponding GOE (grade of execution) score.

Now, each of the nine judges awards a grade, an integer from -3 to +3 for each technical element reflecting the quality of the execution. For every technical element, each of these values carries a specific numerical value, as determined by the ISU SoV (Scale of Value) chart. The highest and the lowest values are then discarded and the average is taken of the remaining seven values. This average is the GOE score for the element.

Yuna Kim's TES comprised of a base difficulty score of 57.49 and a GOE score of 12.20 giving a total TES of 69.69. Adelina Sotnikova's base difficulty score of 61.43 and GOE score of 14.11 gave a total TES of 75.54. Before we start delving into the details of the scoring, we must mention that Kim's base score should have been higher to begin with. More details will be found below.

Let's begin with Adelina's triple Lutz- triple toeloop (3L+3T) jump combination which was her first technical element of the program. A review has shown that she made an incorrect entry. It should have been made with a back outside edge, but hers wasn't (skaters call the mistake a ""flutz""). This error carries a mandatory -0.7 GOE score but in fact she received a GOE score of +1.00. It turns out that one of the judges even gave her a base GOE score of +3.00 (remember that +3 is the highest GOE grade that can be awarded for each technical element). Furthermore, the second jump in the combination was under-rotated by more than a 1/4 turn. By ISU rules this means that the base value of the element should have been reduced by 30%, in this case by 1.80 points.

Next, we recall that Sotnikova messed up the triple flip-double toeloop-double loop combination in the middle of her routine for which she received a 0.90 GOE deduction. ISU rules stipulate that a step-out (in this case a stumble) carries a mandatory unscaled 2 point deduction translating to a 1.40 GOE deduction. So we realise that she received 0.50 points more than she ought to have for the error, notwithstanding the fact that her wildly tilted axis of rotation for the double loop should have incurred an extra GOE penalty. So for the two jump combinations, Sotnikova received at least 4.00 GOE points MORE than she ought to have and this even before we begin the head-to-head comparisons of the technical elements.

Be that as it may, we know that she received a GOE score of 14.01 for the remaining ten technical elements of the program. This is 2.81 points more than Yuna's GOE score for ALL of her twelve technical elements COMBINED. Except for the 3L+3T, NONE of the comparable jumps yielded Yuna a higher GOE score. This is very strange, as we recall that she executed them all flawlessly and especially as her jumps were cleaner with better mid air positioning and travelled further as well as being generally around 10cm higher off the ice than the Russian's. In the triple flip Adelina received a GOE of +1.50 whereas Yuna received only +1.20. It is worth noting that in this jump the Russian pre-rotated by nearly 180 degrees whereas the Korean did not pre-rotate at all, a fact which should have resulted in a swing of GOE points in the latter's favour.

In the triple Salchow, Adelina received a GOE of +1.20 whereas Yuna received +0.90. Replay shows that Adelina's jump was again rather poor, hardly rising above the ice. For the double axel, Adelina received a GOE of +1.07, whereas Yuna received +0.79, this in spite of the Korean jumping towards the end of the program for which there is a 10% GOE bonus. For the layback spin, Adelina received a GOE of +1.07, with Yuna receiving +0.64. For the change foot combination spin, Adelina received a GOE of +1.21, with Yuna receiving only +0.71.

No right thinking person would therefore deny that Yuna's GOE scores in all of the above categories should at the very least match the Russian's, if not exceed by a significant margin. Even if we are extremely generous to Adelina and we match the GOE scores for the comparable elements above, simple arithmetic shows that Yuna's TES should already be increased by at least 1.81points.

Furthermore, Yuna received a LOWER GOE for the triple Lutz- triple toeloop combination (+1.60) than in all of her previous international competitions. As was clear to see, it was executed perfectly. It merited a GOE of at least +2.00 as it has done throughout her career. It is also worth noting that in the choreographed sequence for which they both received +1.50, the Russian almost lost her balance towards the end.

Let us now consider the step sequence GOE marks for which Adelina received +1.70 (level 4) and Yuna +1.14 (level 3). Now, this is where the rigging truly came into its own and I will explain why later. For each of the non-jump elements, the panel decides the level of difficulty, which is an integer between 1 and 4. Now a higher level earns a higher base difficulty score. However, in the case of the step sequence, a higher level not only earns a higher base score but crucially, also a HIGHER GOE. Let me be more specific- suppose one step sequence is deemed to be a level 3 and another a level 4. An award of +3 GOE grade to both attempts in fact translates to +2.1 GOE points for the latter but only +1.5 GOE for the former and +2 GOE grade translates to +1.4 GOE and +1.0 GOE respectively. It turns out that Yuna was given only a level 3 whereas Adelina a level 4. This was also highly questionable- even a casual observer would have noticed that the Russian was somewhat shaky in her footwork and noticeably less assured than the Korean.

Impartial judges would have therefore, at the very minimum, awarded Yuna with the same level and the GOE score as her Russian counterpart for the step sequence.

With all of the above points taken into consideration, simple arithmetic shows that Yuna's TES should have been increased by at least 2.97 points. Add to this the further mandatory 4.00 Base Value point deduction Adelina's should have received for the jump errors and we end up with a total swing of 6.97 points.

Now, the difference in the final scores between the two skaters was 5.48 points. Hence merely on the basis of a minimal correction to the TES alone, Yuna Kim should have been crowned as Olympic champion.

Next, consider the PCS (program component score) which evaluates the artistic merit of the program. Five categories are assessed: skating skills, transition, performance/execution, choreography and interpretation. Each is marked out of 10, averaged and then multiplied by a factor of 1.6. Sotnikova scored an average of 9.30 out of 10 to give a PCS of 74.41, including a mark of 9.50 for choreography. This is compared to Yuna Kim's PCS of 74.50. Again, any impartial observer will agree that Yuna Kim's performance in all of the five categories above was of a far superior quality, especially in the choreography and interpretation sections. That Sotnikova got to within 0.09 of Kim in the PCS is simply ludicrous.

Let me finish by addressing the one unresolved question alluded to above, namely how is it possible that Kim's base difficulty TES score for the step sequence was manipulated. The answer lies not with the judges but with the technical controller and his two assistants who ALONE have the authority to set the difficulty level of the spins, the step and the spiral sequences. It turns out that the controller was a Russian, Alexander Lakernik, who was the former vice president of the Russian figure skating federation and that the assistant technical specialist was a former Russian, Olga Baranova, who apparently just so happened to be a former skating coach of Sotnikova.
 
So all this leads to just one inescapable conclusion- that Yuna Kim was robbed of her rightful Olympic gold medal in Sochi. And such has been the subtlety and skill with which the scoring was massaged that many commentators have yet to grasp exactly how the manipulation took place."
unbelievable that she didn't get gold - she was perfect.
"Her musicality is out of the world.
She is a gift."
We need to make it clear this time who is the real winner .
정말 정말 자랑스러워요. 우리나라가 김연아 선수 덕분에 알려질 수 있었고 빛날 수 있었어요! 우리나라에 이렇게 훌륭한 사람이 있으니 뿌듯하네요.
0:48 on yuna’s opening triple lutz triple toe there was a brief flash in the crowd. Plus with the yelling at the second triple lutz they knew what they were doing.... just can’t believe how rude the crowd was to yuna that night
Yuna Kim’s talent is way out of the ordinary. She’s one of the kind. Gorgeous. Just gorgeous 💗
I'm crying again----  I couldn't watch this performance for a few years after Olympic because  I was so sad
"I'm russian-american and I always root for Russians when they are very talented performers which many of them are. Unfortunately however in this scenario, Yuna Kim definitely deserved the gold medal. I want Russians to win fair and square, not because of politics"
KIm Yu Na should have won the gold. The absolute most beautiful skater ever.
"the way she interpret the music with her eyes, arms movement - you just can tell that this program was well thought out, another masterpiece"
"my heart is still aching watching this :(
i watched it live...and my jaw literally dropped when I saw her score :(
Adios Nonino...so beautiful, so sad,
cant believe how she was robbed in front of million eyes."
"The ending is really sad. She deserved much better (not only ranking, but also atmosphere, supports, ect.) The last time this great woman competed. We never see her on the ice again after that year. It's been a long time but feels like only yesterday. Hard to find peace and coming to term with unjust failures. Like leaving an untangled knot in your heart. It will always be there. This performance gets even better with time. Somehow it makes everything more bittersweet. It may sound silly but my love for figure skating started and ended with her (now I still watch but mostly the men's for Jin Boyang bc he's Chinese and beautiful like her too)"
SHE IS STILL THE GREATEST IN HISTORY 👑🥰
Real champion Queen Yuna.👑 I miss her...
This is a silver? Commentators are so biased. This is poetry.
"Lol did anyone notice the title was changed....? Wow, even after 6 years they’re still salty that more people watch Yuna’s performance compared to Sotnikova’s."
Yuna deserved the gold more than anyone in this competition.
"On 02.22.2022, Sotnikova 3.3 mil and Queen 9.4 mil views. The performance in figure skating ideally should be something that people can remember as art and want to see it again and again. In that regard, we know what was the most beautiful performance was in Sochi. Adiós Queen Yuna, you will always be remembered"
"A LOT of people on here clearly did not pay attention to the short program scores. Yuna Kim is considered to be ""technically behind"" Adelina in this free skate, but Yuna's short program was technically ahead of Adelina's, yet their scores were identical. Yuna's score in her short program should have been, without a doubt, over 74 points because of her advanced technicality and the difficulty of her program all together. Yuna getting a 74 score is what lead to the 4 point gap in their scores after the free skate was over."
"Is it only me? I'm presuming that the commentators are unfairly biased against Yuna Kim. It seems like they're using negative expressions for Yuna's performance intentionally such as ""languid easiness"" or ""I don't think it was a match for Sotnikova."" But seriously, really? I didn't know that ""Technically better"" means jumps with wrong edge, two-foot landing and under rotation like Sotnikova has done in Sochi? 😂

It seems like they're diminishing Yuna's phenomenal performance for the purpose of disturbing public opinion or justifying the corrupted result. But sorry, people wouldn't be blinded by disinformation.

Yuna Kim is the true champion in Sochi. Ironically, this video proves that fact."
"I feel sad, angry, and cheated even though I wasn't the one partaking in the Olympics or performing this amazing routine. Yuna Kim deserved gold and we all knew it, Sochi Olympics 2014 will forever be known as a fraud."
"연아 생각나서 왔어요.. 마지막에 점수 발표 할 때 너네 그럴줄 알았다 ㅎ 하는
저 헛웃음.. 맘아프..
지금은 행복하게 지내는것 같아서 다행이구요. 언제나 건강하게 잘 지내길.. 연아는 대한민국의 꽃 이였어 🎉"
I do not remember who won the gold medal.But Yuna Kim was my winner.And that's for sure....
"Yuna kim, you're ""the queen"". 😊"
The Only One who can melt music in the Ice
True Olympic champion Queen Yuna. She's amazing! I miss her.
"I'm from Russia. But Kim Yuna skating I like a lot more. 
She was worthy of victory."
"You dont see quality technique in jumps like this anymore. Now the skating world is full of girls pre rotating and underrotating and using full blade asisstance its honestly quite sad. She's just the full package, I think this performance marked the end of an era."
Yuna is the best. She deserves gold medal for this. :) I don't know where this hatred comes from.. But remember all the mistakes people made due to hatred. Let's not do that. Koreans are amazing people. I don't know why a couple of people with extreme views attack Yuna. She will be remember as one of the greatest skaters and one doesn't need a gold medal to prove it. Unfortunately for Yuna haters she already has one with a world record. 
Queen Yuna is Figure skating herself and she is absolutely the greatest skater. Miss her a lot.
This program should have won a gold medal. The Olympic Games have lost all fairness.
I get goosebumps at 2:02 every time.. She's truly dancing tango on ice.
"Yuna Kim was a Symbol and the Essence of the Olympic spirit even though THE Olypmics used her and insulted her. ( Shame on You ISU, IOC! You tried to sacrifice her on your greedy feast! ) But, the moment Nike deserted her, she herself became a goddess of Olympus. I'll worship her eternally."
Goosebumps. No one will match her performance.
she deserved more than gold.
"While Sotnikova may have had a more difficult routine, Yuna's beautiful performance will be the one I'll remember. Yuna won gold in my heart."
"It's okay. Let that loser got the gold. You deserve a diamond, Queen!"
"Long Live the Queen Yuna!!!   She is the real Queen on the ice!!!    She is just natural Beauty and Elegance!!!   It's 2022,  and I miss her bad..."
"There should be an entirely new category just for her, called something like the Platinum or Diamond Medal... meaning that she is one of a kind and there hasn't been and will never be anyone better than her."
"She's the standard, even untill now"
"The day I had watched this on television I was angry. Kim Yuna had a stunning performance but still won silver. *While the Russian contestant, Adelina Sotnikova* earned the gold ""rightfully"", *you can see her in many photos --- hugging the judges.* 

It was obvious that the Russian judges had let her win even if it may have been less worthy than Kim Yuna's. Some claim that because Russia's hockey team (or some winter team of Russia) had lost, they needed a gold in this sport as compensation. 

All I know is that Kim Yuna should have won with a great performance, but ended her career with a sad note and gracefully accepted a silver -- *demonstrating the true epitome of sportsmanship.*"
We know that Yuna kim is real olympic champion
"I am Russian, 2020! This is gold!!! The judges are corrupted!!!"
Trully the most elegant creature I've seen on ice. So sad she didn't win.
"Oh ISU, just give Gold back to Yuna, I think the majority of the world can agree that she was robbed"
"There's something chilling about listening to the commentators pointing out the aspects of Yuna's skate that made it the clear superior to Sotnikova's, but then realizing as they're looking at the numbers that the judges had inflated Sotnikova's score so high there was no way she wouldn't win. This was the beginning of a dark era in women's figure skating that persists still. The Russians had infiltrated the IOC, opening the door for the blind eye that has been continually turned to incorrect  jumping technique, pre-rotating of jumps, and incredible inflation in GOE and PCS for the Russian women."
"why did they magnify yuna's simple mistake at the end with a replay? sotnikova did alot of mistakes but weren't even shown on replay after her performance, her double loop landed on 2 foot, and her 3 lutz wrong blade. They made their cheating so obvious."
I'm still not over her not getting gold...
"Adelina's best score in worlds is 116.36 in 2013 world championship. Its amazing what a bunch of Soviet Judges can do. 

In 2012, World juniors she scored 111. in the same year she scored 125 in Russian championships

2013, at Worlds she scored 116, at Russian championship she got 123.

In 2013-14 season, she scored 105 in Japan, 108 in China. But somehow 140 in Russian championships"
This beautiful Olympic champion Queen Yuna is getting married in October! congratulations!!
"i dont really watch figure skating, but i think that the fact that i remember her name and not the actual gold medalist says something."
Not the first or last to say it. She was ROBBED
The step sequence beginning 1:50 alone deserved gold!!!
"She's still the best women figure skaters!!  Nobody can beat her the beauty, elegance and love she has for skating.  You can feel the emotions through her skating.  2022 women's figure skating I didn't really see that."
"In Russia, many believe that Yuna actually won the gold."
Can I just comment on her make up. Jesus that is a work of art in itself.
she looks so pretty omg
"she skated absolutely beautifully, such a talented talented skater"
몇몇 피알못들이 김연아는 지금 시대에 있었으면 발렸을거라 하는데 전혀 발릴거같지 않고 오히려 지금 메뎁 이런애들 바르겠지. ㅎ  스케이팅과 기술이 비교가 안될정도로 뛰어난데
"Sotnikova winning was the biggest joke of figure skating history. It was ridiculous then and it just gets worse as more time passes. Yuna was skating with an ease she's never brought. Her skating skills weaved in and out of the music beautifully, and her jumps had the size and power you should expect at this level."
2 times olympic champion❤
"Robbed of a gold. This was better than 2010 imo. i'm no figure skating critic, but there is nothing better in sports or art than Yuna Kim on the ice.  2x Gold Medal champion in my eyes.  Always"
"Yuri on ice brought me here, the show has sparked an interest in me for ice skating. This girl is inspiring. I can't believe anyone can look so graceful and elegant on ice. She is truly amazing ."
Its 2020 and I’m still mad. It was Yuna’s last olimpic.
"Russia audience manner LoL.
When yuna kim started jump , they shouted ""Aha"". And when yuna kim's performance was finished, they shouted 'Russia'. Sochi olympic was dirty, Because of corruption, doping, no manner audince 👎👎"
It's 2023 and I'm convinced no one will ever top this. It's the elegance and artistry that is missed nowadays
"In my opinion, she was better than Adelina. Yuna is the queen of my heart. I disagree with score.((( Yuna, u r the greatest figure skater. We love u."
Queen Yuna was robbed. She deserved the gold.
She born to be legend
This is the perfect definition of the gold medal performance.
"金メダルだとおもったんだけどなあ、、
あと、黒いドレスが一番似合うと思う^^*
black dress looks good on her. 
You're a true gold medalist.
perfect performance！

Please excuse my poor English.
(from Japan)"
Kim Yuna Is the Real Champion
"Christmas 2019, still mad about sochi’s decision"
10 años han pasado y sigo pensando que esta rutina se merecía oro y más.
It is a shame that her performance only qualified as a silver medal.
I still can't accept the fact that they don't give back the Gold medal to Yuna until now. The whole world knows how the judges inflated Adelina's scores. Those corrupt Russian officials. Shame on you! Give back Queen Yuna's gold medal.
She's the legit Queen. She was robbed. I just can't move on.
The real gold medalist.
She is Gold... It is true.
"So many Russian skaters crash and burn and are forgotten… There’s a reason Yuna Kim has had such longevity in hearts and minds, just like the great Michelle Kwan. She changed the sport and brought the artistry back."
Great! The gold medal video! :D
예전에 볼 때는 몰랐는데 이때 김연아 진짜 어렸구나… 벤쿠버에서 금메달 땄을때는 더 어렸었는데 진짜 대단하다. 대단하고 멋지다 진심으로 ㅠㅠ
Yuna was robbed by those cheating russian judges :( This was gorgeous and was gold all the way!
Doping was not enough to win so Russians had to buy off the judges lmao. That tells you how great Yuna Kim was!
Honest and Beautiful Silver Medal is better than a Greed and Dirty Gold Medal.
Ten years later this is still my favourite figure skating program. A timeless masterpiece. 👑
And there is Sotnikova. What a joke Sochi Olympics was.
I never saw the gold medalist performance. How did this woman not get Gold?
It's been 2 years now and I'm still trying to grasp how Sotnikova's PCS marks were considered equal to this and Carolina Kostner... It's honestly embarrassing...
"Her every step, every move is golden"
GOLD 100%
"she deserves the gold,"
I will miss her.
"Such a full body, artistry, technicality, delicacy and importantly Grace! Bewitched each time"
"Robbed.
Years later and I still can get over it."
"I'll never get over this... how classy she was despite the blatant robbery... sotnikova showed no class, claiming she was better and storming out of press conferences..."
she got level 3 in a step grade??? no way.. so unfair
"You know, I've noticed that all the the TRUE ice skating champions have been robbed at least once of what they truly deserved on the podium. She is part of the true QUEENS of Olympic athletes, those that history will remember."
I'm glad every time Russia wins a gold medal...but not like this. Unfair victory still feels hollow and meaningless 8 years later. I'd rather we win by fair means instead of cheating. It only puts athletes in a difficult position where they get attacked for what is obviously not their choice. As for Yuna...she will forever remain the Queen of the ice and the winner in our hearts.
I don't even remember the name of the winner.
She deserved gold medal.
Queen Yuna is surely the gold!!! Timeless Olympic Champion!
Correction. She did win gold.. She is and always will be the supreme champion over those cheating russians..
"Seriously, Sotnikova's winning in Sochi must be just the biggest shame to whole history of figure skating. Sincere apology for all other prestigious figure skaters. In terms of presentation, I just do not understand why Sotnikova's been ridiculously over-scored. She should have been scored even less than Carolina. I personally enjoyed the Carolina's program the most this time among all of her other programs so far. Needless to say, Sotnikova's technical score is also quite unacceptable."
"Of course they chose a commentary that's convenient for the Russian skater out of all the shocked and angry ones when it's not even norm to have commentary in Olympic video. The reason Yuna lost isn't because of one less triple. She was horribly underscored in SP and got level 3 in step despite it was TANGO while the other skater got level 4 for a junior level step sequence. One of the judges even gave her 0 for her jump and it makes no sense. I recommend Italian commentary, they flat out scream ""why are they ruining our sport!"" over and over."
Don’t know why she did not get gold?! She’s the queen.
2019 i’m still mad
I still can't accept this. sigh.

"Yuna really is the Queen, not just of Korea, but the world.

But Yuna's safety will be secured by the United Nations.
Enough said.

“The Queen”
"I am neither from Korea or Russia, but I strongly disagree with Kim Yuna as a silver medalist. she is suppose to be the gold medalist. this is why I think she is the gold medalist :
First, her short program is done perfectly, and I saw an event where she got 80 for this program, and yet, she got 74 in sochi, which has a huge gap from 80. Therefore, she should have score about more than 78 here.
Second, her free skate technical score should be similar as her les misarables fs, as all the jumps are the same. and in 2013, she scored 148. in sochi, her technical score might be lower a little bit because of her second triple lutz, but her component score is better, so she should have scored 148 here.
Third, Sotnikova short program has easier jump technique, which in 2014 judging system, ""the harder the jump is better, whether it is mis rotate or wrong edge"" which affect Yuna Kim a lot, but not sotnikova. 
Forth, Sotnikova free skate component score is over-scored, as a musician myself, I know how to express art and sotnikova should have scored less than 71 in component score.
Fifth, regarding to those comment about Yuna Kim expression through out the program, I think she has the perfect expression for this song. I was moved watching it. expressing art especially in figure skating doesn't only mean express happiness. there r lots of other expression. and if Yuna kim was happy with this song, it is not suitable.

In conclusion, yuna kim should have score 78+148 = 226ish
and sotnikova should have score 71+145 = 216 at most.

I am just saying the fact!! not just say my preference as I enjoy all skating program and choose the best quality one."
"I've made some calculations and... For those, who say that Yuna had less base value - it was still enough for her to win. They just underscored her on GOE - that's all. Even with objectively/subjectively less GOE on some elements, it would have still been enough for her to win..."
This was VERY OBVIOUSLY rigged. Yuna Kim deserved the gold medal and anyone with eyes or a heart knows this to be true. I'm very ashamed of the Russians for their biased unfair treatment.
"""Wow that's a Silver? Then how is the gold medalist?""
After watching 'the stealer'
""....Are you sure?😞"""
"sometimes I feel glad that she retired, this diry sport does not deserve to keep on having someone as great as her"
"How on earth this program didn't win the gold medal??

This is unreal musicality program above anyone else"
"I’m not a Yuna stan, so missed out on Sochi Ladies FS and never really wanted to watch it before. Just now I started to watch both AS’ and Yuna’s programs. The result is absolutely ridiculous! A huge robbery from Yuna! AS didn’t skate clean with flaky landing, and her skating skills and artistry couldn’t even come close to Yuna’s. I already knew FS was scandalous but didn’t expect such a big scandal! Shame on Rusfed, ISU and Olympics!"
Sochi Olympics was not fair for another countries including figure skating! It was just a festival for Russia﻿
when the one who got silver is better than the one gets gold...
Two time olympic champion 👏 I miss her ❤️
true gold medalist
Outstanding skater.
Kim Yuna is best
She flows like the wind. Beautiful.
"I hated how the audience were so disrespectful saying Adelina's name during Yuna's scores coming out. They showed no respect to the foreign athlete who deserved the gold medal. No offense to Adelina's fans, though. I think she's a good skater...but not enough for a gold medal. 

dear judges, we know you rigged the whole women's figure skating event. shame on you. Yuna is a true champion!"
아마도  지구 종말까지  최고인듯
"Why didn't she win. 
I'm triggered"
They way she moved on the ice is unbelievably beautiful. She was born to dance tango on ice ❤ Queen Yuna!! 👑
Seeing this makes me wonder why she didnt win the whole thing???  The judges and the Russian contestant should be ashamed of themselves
If this is silver.. what in the world is gold 0.0
"Hey, why the title has changed from ""Superb Performance"" to just ""Free Skate""??? I guess the reason is superb performance was by silver medalist, not by champion(fake)."
"She is above ""athletic"", she is even ""artistic"". So elegant... While many watch her performances in Vancouver, Adios Nonino is my favorite one... the completion of her career with mature combination of skill + presentation. Like well aged wine...."
Disappointed with Russia.
What are the dislikes for ???
"once a queen, always a queen. the scores say nothing. you deserve my gold medal. even though you won't be there, see you RUSSIANS at the 2018 winter olympics in KOREA! :)"
Sotnikova won the Gold Medal ..... *But Yuna Kim Won Millions of Hearts !!!*
Amazing. The Queen.
Истинная КОРОЛЕВА♥️♠️
For all your info guys. The jumps that she made during her performance were the same jumps in her les mis program.lets just say that her scores here are reasonable but sotnikovas was way too high. For those who say she played it safe. Well yuna is the kind of skater who sticks with her program. Even if she will land samw triple with sotnikova. Yuna will still not win bec the crowd will shout only for sotnikova bec this is done in russia. They have all the support. Kudos for yuna for not falling. The crowd were so rude that night . Personally as a viewer. Yuna's performance was better than sotnikova. It was cleaner and beautifully presented. 
"After 7 years I come back to see this performance again. Still the original felling. Its amazing, and I can't believe that Yuna missed the golden medal."
"The best figure skater, The worst olympic ever after."
SHE WAS ROBBED
"the commentator clearly knows nothing about figure skating."" technically it wasn't a match for sotnikova?? "" in any other competition, yu-na would have won by miles.. "
"If your daughter wants to figure skate, watch Kim Yu-na's video. Kim Yuna's skating is the textbook itself."
Yuna on ice
"The answer is very simple.
It will be done when yuna and sotnikova interchange their program.
Yana can accomplish sotnikova's program even better than sotnikova.
But sotnikova can't perform this program. 
"
She s so prefect
피겨역사상 가장 뛰어난 선수가 긴 시간동안 자기를 갈고 닦았을 때만 나올 수 있는 프로그램이라 생각함
How she didnt win gold still confuses me. Must be rigged.
Beautiful ...
"For me yuna is the real winner. The russian girl did great on her jumps but no way near to yunas components score. Funny bec nbc suddenly shift to adelina.they were trying to explain why yuna lost bec of technical scores.they were trying to explain to viwers in cnn etc just to protect the scores. If sotnikova's winning is really convincing, no need for them to explain but why? Clearly we all have eyes to see. They were just being defensive bec they to know who is the real winner that night. And she was robbed"
"Such elegance , it never look mechanical.  Like every move is flawing like water such graceful way to skate , just beautiful."
"So I guess the male commentator is right. Sotnikova's technical components beat Yuna's significantly that it was hard for Yuna to catch up. But how about their short programs though? How did Sotnikova score higher technically than Gracie and Carolina? Sotnikova's combination jump is technically lower in her short.  So how did she end up in 2nd place in the short? If Sotnikova's short program scores were not inflated, she should've placed 4th in the short program. Meaning, she only should've been 2nd or 3rd overall.  "
Her gold was stolen
She was robbed.
"In the Olympics, it was a game that made me realize that national power is important, not skills."
Sochi kill figure skating.
home buff Russia
wow... fabulous....
"Figure skating is not just a jumping competition, but an art. Of course, even if it was a simple jumping contest, no one can follow Kim Yu-na's jump in the textbook"
why do the commenters sound very unexcited .......
sochi scandal.
"por dios Yuna, no puedo dejar de emocionarme , vuelvo a ver este video a casi diez años y lloro con la misma emoción de ese día que vi tu performance en vivo desde la patagonia argentina, abrazos y mas abrazos desde el otro lado del mar"
"I cannot believe she didn't get the gold.  She deserved it.  How did that happen ?  Not fair, she deserved the gold absolutely"
"She is the perfect figure skater, she combines strength and royal grace! Her silver medal is perceived as gold by me!"
"볼때마다 생각하는건데 빙판위에서 저 신들린듯한 컨트롤이 너무 신기함 모든 상황을 통제하는 듯한 모습
밴쿠버 이후로 연느님에게는 그냥 승리마저 초월한, 한단계 올라선듯한, 도가 트인.. 이런 수식어가 어울렸던 것 같다"
Recently I went ice skating and thought of Yuna and went back to watch her performances. It’s not even abt the skills but the emotion and how poetic her performances were. She’s truly amazing the one and only
10 years later and I am still MAD about her not getting gold.
"She is incredible, so so beautiful in everything she is, everything she does!"
"The more I watch this, the more I realize how incredibly special this performance was. Artistry above and beyond any other."
Can a person be cooler than Yuna just standing up and waving at the audience when the results are announced without a care? 😂
"Criminally under-scored in the short, allowing that other girl to sneak past her. No doubt, Yu Na deserved the gold."
"Wow. I immediately noticed that her skating here has gained a kind of mature, graceful elegance to it that I didn't see in 2010. Literally everything, from her jumps to her spins and step sequences, has improved tremendously. What a beautiful evolution as a skater. She got robbed.😡"
True Olympic champion Queen Yuna ⛸️👑
Still unmatched. She is truly one of a kind.
"이로부터 8년이나 지났는데 
이때 김연아의 경기는 지금과 비교해도 
아직도 압도적이라는게 놀라울 뿐"
"なんて素敵な滑りなんだろう…！
まさにレジェンド✨
コンビネーションジャンプの美しさや表現力、スケーティングの滑らかさなど唯一無二の滑りだと思う…。
ソチ五輪の本当の金メダルはキムヨナさんだと個人的には思います😂
ソチ五輪の羽生さんもよかったし、男子も女子もいい戦いだったなぁ…。"
She is the true winner
"It's not the color of the medal that makes her great, but the crown she bears. The champion, the queen."
"This is what we call dancing on the ice, she’s the queen no doubt!"
WHEN SILVER SHINED BRIGHTER THAN GOLD 😭
She is a legend. I miss her..
Gold medal in Sochi 2014
"Seriously,, she is the queen and legendary"
Miss our one and only Queen so badly.. thesedays figure skating is not the figure skating that I had loved..
this is still the best free skate i have ever seen
"it's 2022, this name Yuna Kim is still the one and the only name I would say if ppl ask me who's the best skater in the world. As for the Russian girl, she doesn't matter. Not back then, not now, not ever. 
THIS is what gold medal truly means."
"очаровательная,техничная,энергичная Юна!её выступления-бальзам на душу❤️"
NOBODY!! can dance with the music like Yuna. The highest level of musicality
I don't see anything as moving as this nowadays. This is art.
She may not win gold but won our hearts ❤️
She is the epitome of artistry and power even with sustaining back injury.
Just a Queen! No one can beat Yuna and Yuzuru 👸🫅
금메달 안준다고 징징대는 누구랑은 다르게 조작질한 점수를 보면서도 담담하게 웃어 넘기는 성숙한 성격까지 진짜 멋지다 연아퀸
"i just cant stop watching this move 1:11 so smooth, so simple but its so eye catching and she nailed it"
we all know who's more deserving of the gold medal
"3:50~4:06 anyone can't do that performance. The most, the best performance that expresses tango. Perfect."
피겨가 단순 스포츠가 아닌 예술이란걸 보여주는 거 같아요 너무 아름다워🥺🫶
"The queen skated such a timeless program with such sophistication in every moment. As the last program of her competitive career, she demonstrated a level of artistry that will forever be the gold standard that defines the word ""figure"" in the name of this sport. I will keep coming back to this poetry in the years to come like I have been in the past."
I think it’s a lifelong shame for the figure skating judges of that time that they overlooked such a perfect performance and gave the gold medal to Sotnikova’s mediocre one.
"10 years later, i still think she deserved the gold medal"
Truly an iconic performance
Her skating is clean and technical.   Professional
"still the QUEEN, without doping but with GLANCE, LEGIT and AUTHENTIC as a skater."
1:10 this choreography alone solos Sotnikova's entire free program 😂
🥇Two-Times Olyimpic Champion🥇
10 years later and I'm still bitter about her not winning gold....
long live the queen! Two times olympic champion!
The most elegant skating ever.
"Perfect performance, perfect choreography, perfect skating skills, perfect choreo transitions, perfect composition overall - but only 74.50, only 0.09 ahead of Adelina?.. Ten years have passed, but I'm not still over"
My goodness!! her step sequence is one of the best I've ever seen.
The queen! This gold was Absolutely sold. Yuna was the winner!
"Superb dance ability with grace and elegance. The nuance foot work is unmatch.

She is so connecting with the music like no one does.

The quality of her edges is out of this world compare to nowaday standard."
Forever Queen 👑 Forever 2x Olympic Champion 👑 Queen Yuna Kim
2 time olympic champion queen yuna 💎💎💎medal-yellow-first-redmedal-yellow-first-red
"Adios Nonino is Queen Yuna's last program. This is such a perfect program. Acting to the tune of the music, she presents impeccably perfect skating and moving performances. 

But I don't watch this program very often. Because I know how lonely she was in a poor environment during the nearly 20 years.

And we know What kind of absurdity did the Sochi make to prevent Yuna from becoming a two-time Olympic champion.

All this emotion is projected into the program. So, just looking at it makes my heart hurt and hurt.

My queen, please put down your burden and rest in peace. Thank you for giving us a lot of inspiration and comfort. Long live the queen🙏🏻"
"Даже в России все знают  что победила Юна Ким. Там целую неделю говорили зрителям, что победа была справедливой. Правда состоит в том , что Аделина больше не выступала в качестве олимпийской чемпионки, потому что никогда бы не показала свой результат в другой стране. Юна Ким и без этой золотой медали останется королевой!"
"I’m still watching her legendary programs until 2023
Her skating makes me feel alive 
Feel so honored to have the most talented skater in Korea 🇰🇷 
Long live the queen 👑"
The movements of Yuna are incomparable for Sotnikova's. You don’t even have to understand the true depths of figure skating to see this  I just don’t get how she didn’t win gold . She knows graceful skating .
Really miss her. I love her artistic step sequences
Nobody remebers R-girl. Yuna is the legend. Real champion
Her jumps are smooth like butter.
Absolute high level skating skills
I've got a funny feeling that this performance will be remembered for a long long time even it wasn't gold.
"For me,the performance of Yuna Kim is absolutely better than AS,shame of judges."
"Honestly, her performances were much even better than the legendary Vancouver Olympic. Sorry for her score, Figure skating that Yuna loved was dead at the point of Sochi."
"I'm Russian and absolutely love her skating.... Her artistry, control of movement, maturity, simply bravo!🤩😍"
"2024, ten years has passed and Yuna still is the Queen of the ice. No other medalists, as far as technically greater in their performances, can skate better than she. It's breathtaking ❤"
The real gold medalist. Everyone knows the truth. Queen Yuna 👑
she's won gold and everyone knows it.
"Season started again but can't help keep coming to watch this, amazing performance but remind of heartbreaking result..."
"I don't even remember the other one's name. In Sochi, there was only one true queen and her name is Yuna Kim"
2 time Olympic champion. She is the real Queen still 2024! really miss her.
"This is the performance of a champion, historic! The two time Olympic Champion!"
"High artistic expression, restrained deep emotion, the charm of farewell, combined with her own legendary experience, what a fabulous performance! Long live the queen❤"
True Olympic champion ❤️ I miss Queen Yuna
"11 YEARS AND I STILL CANT GET OVER THE FACT THAT SHE GOT SECOND, I THINK THE JUDGES TROLLED HER ON PURPOSE BECAUSE HER TECHNICAL SCORE WAS 69.69"
"If this is not deservingly of the gold medal, than I don’t know what would deserve a silver… it doesn’t matter, she shown what is a beautiful performance :)"
She is still the greatest in history.
True Olympic champion Queen Yuna 👑 She is best ever.
True champion and forever the queen!
Gold medal. Olympic Gold.  We all know that.  The queen.
Still the greatest female figure skater.
1:10 this choreography alone deserved gold...
"지금도 여전히 김연아 선수 경기를
계속 보고 있어요.
그립습니다.
퀸 연아 ❤"
Two time Olympic Champion Queen Yuna!
"지이이인짜 잘탄다 와….
고급지고 우아하고 여유있고 안무 하나하나다잘보이고 박자감쩔고 미쳤어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ"
Yuna's steps are not worse a bit than Carolina's and Mao's but the two girls got level 4 with like 1.50-1.70 GOE and Yuna's one got only level 3 with 1.14 GOE... Unfair!
"1:50 - 2:43 watch and learn !!

The definitions of true figure skating not just jumping not just moving around like  random robot

The combination of sophisticated dancer and amazing basic skating skills combines with superb interpreter and exqusite musicality

The look , the feel , the percision , skating skills , maturity

One of the greatest foot work for women individual ever

so aesthetic"
"다른 사람들 연기를 보면 그냥 스케이트 타는구나.. 싶은데 김연아 연기는 진짜 그냥 한편의 작품을 보는 거 같음
표정이며 동작이며 점프며 하나같이 다 예술작품 같아"
"That day the queen was just like wind over the ice! 
She did it so beautifully and effortlessly that at times she seems barely human and that's what figure sports should be all about.
Shame on the judges for overlooking that je ne sais quoi that turns exercising into art!"
10 years later and im still bitter about her not winning gold
Real gold winner 2014
2023년 지금도 마지막 스핀  들어갈때  소름돋는다. 레전드...  퀸... 영원히......
SHE WAS ROBBED this woman glides on the ice like an angel or a fairy 😍
2022 and im stell here to whatch her. She is The olymic Champion
Yuna's powerful and stable tripleーtriple jump is much more beautiful artistically than recent Russian girls' shaky quadruple.
"Don't be sad about the lost medal. We already know who the gold medal belongs to. On the ice, she did her best and finished nicely.

She knows the value of silver and bronze medals. I know the efforts and results of the players who failed to win medals. I believe that's why she didn't complain. 
Because Kim Yu-na's opinion on SNS did not show any criticism or resentment of a particular player.

She could have been more unfair and angry than anyone else, but she practiced the message of love, dignity, harmony, forgiveness, and consideration for peace until the end. I hope we all know that.

I know the reason why her acting still shines is not just because she uses brilliant skills. I communicated with the world through music and appealed through gestures.

What is more precious than remembering the stolen gold medal is the noble sports spirit of Kim Yu-na's silver medal. The silver medal on the neck that day was brighter than the gold medal, and it was beautiful to smile brightly and wave. I'm proud that she's a champion."
"Прошло 10 лет , а я снова бегу посмотреть это легендарное выступление.  Королева Юна выиграла золото чтобы нам там не пытались доказать"
"Her PCS should be the highest PCS of all time in women free skate

genius musical skater and exquisite dancer

supreb artistic skater😊"
A true olympic champion
2023 I'm still watching this performance.  Looks more beautiful than ever.
"“She’s in the loneliest place she could be at the moment, the last performer in the figure skating event in the Sochi Olympic winter games, defending her gold medal, to be one of only three women ever in history to do so. Skating to adios nonino” brings tears to my eyes every time. a once in a lifetime skater, a two time Olympic champion - queen yuna 👑"
One of my all-time favorite tango programs.
Sotnikova won the Gold Medal ..... *But Yuna Kim Won Millions of Hearts !!!*
The judges' cheating will be remembered in 100 years' time. Shame on you all.
Yuna has been real graceful queen
"Look at that deep edges on her foot work sequence with mostly on one foot skating , That call high level of Skating Skills

Musicality is the best of all time , no one can equal this lady"
"To all children, 
Remember, in life, you might not get the reward and recognition you deserve. But that's okay. 
By the way, this was a great performance, wasn't it?"
"今日キムヨナさんの ソチ2014｢IMAGINE」に乗って演技 MUSIC Monday.を見ていたら、とても感動して自然と涙が溢れた。
優しい歌声とキムヨナさんの表情がとてもマッチして、何度も繰り返して見た💜"
She's the best.
She's amazing....a true champion.....
김연아선수가 25살에 은퇴했는데 저는 지금까지 도망만 다니다 26살에 꿈을 찾아서 하루하루 노력하고있습니다. 솔직히 최선을 다하고있진않습니다. 8시부터 10시까지 공부하고있는데 열심히사는건 맞는것 같은데 최선을 다해서 살지는 못하는것 같습니다. 제가 이 영상에 6년전에 댓글을 남겼더군요. 6년후에 다시 이 댓글을 봤을때 제가 바라는 사람이 되어있길 진심으로 바래봅니다.
She's amazing... Yuna kim 👑
"""The queen"" so true."
"In order to appear remotely artistic, you need to absolutely master the techniques first. By saying Yuna’s artistry is on another level, some people seem to forget that it’s, to some degree if not more, her techniques that render her artistry supreme and superior to most other skaters in history.."
Төрешілердің қадам жолдарын үшінші деңгеймен бағалағанын әлі де қабылдай алар емеспін...😔 Өте күрделі қадамдар! Төрешілер әділетсіздік жасаған... 😔 The step sequence alone deserves gold
a decade later and there is no way im still not over this
"전산 상의 기록이 무슨 의미인가 싶어요

This IS THE TRUE WINNER. I will NOT recognize Snot! She is the 👑
"0:24, 0:32 взгляд, 0:52, 1:11, 1:49 посмотрите на эту улыбку, 2:03 тут тоже, 3:12 улыбка, 3:15 эмоции с hand movements, 3:31 кокетка, 3:59 что это если не эмоции? И конечно, легендарная финальная позиция 4:34 Только что дошли руки ответить одной госпоже, что в этой программе ""артистизм проявлялся в пару местах"" 😂😂😂 И я выделила не все моменты, эта программа наполнена хореографией, тот кто хочет - видит это, тот кто не хочет - ..."
"Here in 2022, Yuna Kim is forever Legendary Queen! 👸"
7:27 it looks she knew the result already.... her 4 years of hard work.. russia blowed it. But everyone knows who was the champion.
"개인적으로 카타르시스 느끼는 부분 1:10 1:50 1:59 2:08 2:32 3:05 3:15 3:26 3:32 3:57
매번 빌드업 서사 기승전결이 있는 음악을 골라왔는데 거기에 완전히 녹아드는 안무 연기 기술 실력 의상까지 부족한 게 없는 선수였다 훌륭한 기술로 감탄을 자아낼 뿐 아니라 음악이 주는 감동까지 극대화하는 선수.. 이렇게 보는 사람 눈물나게 하는 피겨 선수가 또 누가 있을까 싶다 이건 무조건 금메달 받아야 하는 연기였는데 아쉽지만 이런 역사와 영상을 남기셨음에 의의를 둬야지"
"Honestly I forgot that she didn’t actually win gold, I’ve completely rewritten it in my mind all the years later lol"
The real queen and two time gold medalist!
True Olympic champion. Queen yuna👑
Tango was such an amazing selection for this routine 🩵
"its 2024 and still not over her not getting a gold. tbh though, she is way above gold. even now, she is the one who's name comes to mind when you think of ice skaters. she is a legend"
"Everythings you want in the ladies champion , watch this"
"столько лет прошло. она просто потрясающая фигуристка, звезда

"Clean on the ice...
Clean of tainted medals...
Clean of performance-enhancing drugs...
Our Clean Queen... Queen Yuna <3"
I really miss her on the ice....
True Champion
Her musicality…. ART
I really like Adios Nonino. Beautiful jumps. What impressed me most are the footworks. Her skating skills and transitions much better than Yuna in Vancouver 2010 olympics. She is the GOAT. She should be the sochi 2014 gold medalist. She is robbed.
dont care what the judges say yuna kim won for me
I shed a tear watching this her preformance is so emotional
I've never seen a skater expressing like her.
EVEN IN 2022 WE STILL WANT JUSTICE FOR YUNA KIM!
Stunning performance! I was mesmerized throughout the entire programme. She is even more captivating as a show skater! Just so lovely to watch!
I'm a fan of Mao Asada but I have to say Yuna deserved this gold!!!
i want to see yuna’s performance again 😭😭😭
Woman figure skating was already dead at 2014 Sochi. Beijing was just some kind of a terrible funeral...
"2024년에도 보는 분들 손! ㅋ 
연아 당신으로 인해 내 30대는 행복했답니다~ 영원한 대한민국의 여왕! ❤"
2024년도 다시보는 연아퀸 말로표현이 안돼요 최고에요
"She move my heart. Whenever I need some feeling, I come here"
"그냥 하염없이 눈물이 나....
그냥 하염없이 서글퍼져....🥲"
"I haven’t seen this performance cause I was so sad that she didn’t get the medal. But this one, amazing. I regret myself that I didn’t see it for a few years."
And everyone regards this elegant artist as Olympic Champion
Her skating is somewhat special... anyone skating like her these days?
This routine has the coolest ending
4:35 “The queen”. No more queen after Yuna.
"i cry everytime, i cant believe she didnt win and was robbed to this day"
앞으로도 네 바퀴 다섯 바퀴 계속 나오겠지? 기술은 계속 개발되니까. 그러나 이만큼 완벽하고 아름다운 올림픽 퍼포먼스가 또 언제 나올 수 있으려나. 올림픽 역사에 길이남을… 틈만나면 올림픽 유튜브 트위터 인스타그램 계정이 김연아 선수 경기를 올리는 건 이유가 있다.
so elegant！！ real 2-time champion！
Yuna Kim  2x Olympic champion 🥇🥇
"TRUE GOLD MEDALIST (even ""not drugs"")"
step sequence is one of the all time great!!!
"So. I'm merely starting to get into ice skating rabbit hole (mostly because of Alena Kostornaia). This is first Yuna's Kim performance I've watched. First thought? This woman has CLASS. Everything looks so effortless and elegant when she does it.
Btw. I also love how her costume looks like it's changing colors around 1:40. A nice, well-thought out touch"
Yuna kim is the only gold medalist.
"The last time when champion of the previous OG in SW Figure skate as a competitive skater on OG was 10 years ago. And she was Yuna. And she'd not just ""skate"", She skate much more than ""enough"" for Gold."
3:57 여기 부분 너무 숨멎는 거 같음 마지막 더블악셀 하나 앞에 두고 저거 하나마저 뛰면 영영 사라질 거 같아서 울컥함
"Самая уверенная в
себе фигуристка и лучшая из лучших !!!"
She skates like An Angel
"""Бағдарламада күрделі элементтер жоқ"" деп жазыпты. Мұнда екі үш айналым лутц бар, флип бар. Тангоға тән хореографиясы мен Yuna camel spin де өте күрделі! Браво, Патшайым!"
"She is beauty 
She is grace
She should have been first place"
watching this in 2023 and crying like a baby
"Ten years later, everyone in the world will know. Most people in the world now know that Kim Yu-na is legendary, but they don't know who the 2014 Sochi Winter Figure Skating Women's Single Gold Medalist is. 
Only Korea and Russia know."
Queen Yunaa <3 A true olympic champion
"QUEEN 
I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE GOT HER GOLD MEDAL"
10 years later and I'm still mad about her not winning gold....
It blows my mind that the other chick won gold when she stumbled out of the same triple-double-double maneuver that Yuna landed flawlessly...
She is gold
Our silver medal is 10000 times better than the gold medal.
"Forget the gold medal, give her a gold statue"
"here after sotnikova admitted to taking substances. yuna skated better and is better regardless to that girl taking drvgs, give her back what she deserves!!"
我心目中的索契金牌得主 yuna kim❤
"I watched Sotnikova first, was impressed. But watching Yuna Kim, I get why she should've won. She is a dancer rather than Sotnikova who is just doing the jumps."
Прелестная девушка. Нежная и прекрасная техника.
I miss Yuna 🥲❤️
"I miss her so bad.  : ( Women's figure skating has become so...manufactured now. All ultra-c elements, barely any artistry/musicality, and rinse+repeat, fully packed routines."
"Великолепная фигуристка,мягкое скольжение,артистичная…….она заслужила золото!"
"Ladies and Gentlemens welcome to time machine of glory day figure skating.  at time when skater skate with the music so well , jumps with accurate techniqiue , mature acting , know how to dance with the melody , effortless speed across the ice

You rarely seen from today skating😅🎉"
Yuna makes figure skating look like a walk in the park
진짜 수준이다름... 이 이상의 여싱 프로그램은 나올수가없다진짜...
"She should open her acedemy about ""How to dance with the music""

Because she is the best"
10 years and we’re all still here
"NOW, again Queen Yuna. miss you..."
"아무리. 보고 또 봐도
나도 예술 하는 사람 이 였지만...
나이가  70  넘어 80  으로 가는
진행중 인데..


와 ~ 
김연아 선수 는 정말 색다르다
 ..박자와 표현. 어쩌면 
인간 으로서  정말...
기막히고 예술성도 너~  무
뛰어나고  ..
인간미도 어느 누구 보다
뛰어나다..
나이 많은 나도 배운다
대한민국 을 영원히 빛낸..
김연아 ...
행복. 하십시요"
"스포츠를 예술로 승화시킴. 곡해석도 뛰어나고. 너무 아름답다.
2002년 베이징 올림픽. 기계같이 곡예만 부리는 러시아선수들을  감히 김연아와 견주어서는 안됨"
"Its 2024, she really deserves the gold"
after 9 years already.. but still one of my fav from the Queen Yuna ❤ I’ve always been watching and watching again except the ugly and unjustified score part 😢
"開催がロシアでなければ、間違いなくキム・ヨナさんが金メダルだった。
悔しいけれど皆んなの心にはヨナクイーンとして語り継がれる事だろう。
美しいキム・ヨナ氷上の天使⛸"
Real Queen! I miss her 👑
Doesn’t matter what color medal she took. People will remember Yuna Kim but not the one who got the gold.
All time legend ✨⛸️ Queen Yuna!
She is a gold medalist..everybody knows
3:25 😭😭😭 so beautiful
Even the way she bends down to scoop up the teddy bear at 5:46 is pure elegance.
"다시 봐도 멋있다
점프 할 때 말고 저렇게 우아하고 부드럽게 연기하는 거 김연아가 최고다"
"キムヨナは高麗大学と高麗大学院で体育教育学を専攻しました。
そしてフィギュアスケートコーチの資格を取得して10年になりました。
現役を引退するやいなやすぐ資格証を取得しましたから。
スポーツ会社の経営陣として参加し、冬季と夏季スポーツを合わせて数多くの種目のメダリスト選手を後援しています。
2022年フィギュアスケートジュニア世界選手権女子フィギュア銀メダリストのシン·ジア選手も金妍兒が運営する会社所属。
本人が現役の時から国際的に活動しながら韓国体育を発展させるために見聞を広げることが好きでした。
度胸もあってメンタルも強く、生まれつきの器が大きい人です。
まだ若い年齢ですが、今も韓国内部ではスポーツ界の最大の大物です。"
It’s been 10 years and I’m still mad she didn’t win the gold
The queen of figure skating♡
김연아 선수 때문에 눈만 높아져서 재미가 없다 영원한 어나더레벨
"Особенно очень нравится эта хореография после флипа! Так кокетливо и стильно, и красиво! Дэвид Уилсон - гений!"
"Gosh 9 years have passed and this performance still gives me chills.. Although her second lutz was a little bit shakier than her first one, the funny thing is that even that jump was way better than other skaters' ordinary jumps.. which just shows how her jumps are so elegant and perfect. Recently heard that Sotnikova admitted that she was tested positive at her first doping test during the Olympic season. Shame that even with doping she had to rely on ISU and Russia's dirty acts to win the gold medal. Russia should be banned from the Olympics and all the other sports events forever."
"I don't know why, but I just had more fun watching kim yuna in the Olympics... I just don't get as excited anymore >< anyone else feel me?  I still do watch them though and they are all talented for sure!"
악보위에서 피겨하는 거 같음.. 멋있다 김연아
"Юна - настоящая королева! Не даром Юной восхищаются по сей день подрастающие фигуристы, именно ей восхищалась в ходе карьеры прекрасная Медведева, Юна - это совершенство. Настоящая победительница олимпиады ❤️"
The only non-doping clean Olympic champion in 2010-2022.
Still a queen
2-time olympic gold medalist 🥇🥇❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
"Come on, Yunafans! Only 6000 more views until 10 millions!"
Russian stole her gold medal
She's priceless ❤
we miss you 👑
"""True gold medalist"""
재생 누르는게 아직도 힘들다.. 그래도 막상 재생하고 보면 또 넋을 놓고 보게 되지만 씁쓸한건 어쩔 수 없네.
이때 진짜 개빡쳐서 일주일동안 울었음 ㅠㅠ ㅅㅂ
Stand for justice! Shame on you IOC AND RUSSIA! Give back the medal to true winner Yuna!!
The male commentator said her level 3 of Layback - so what!? the level 3 of Layback is only 0.5 points behind from level 4. What about Sotnikova's Massive inflation of PCS scores? What about Sotnikova's lutz that didn't called. What about their scores from the short program?!
"キム·ヨナの旦那が最近のインタビューで「俺を好きになってくれる人より俺が好きな人の方が好きだ」 
と発言し、その発言直後に付け加えて「俺があなたのことがもっと好きだ」と話したことがあった。 
嫁のキムヨナに照れくさそうに告白するインタビューみたいでとても可愛かった。(笑)
彼は他のインタビューでは、「俺の恋人が異性の友達を多く持つことも絶対許さない」と強調した。 (笑)
年下の旦那だが、キム·ヨナをしっかり守ってくれそうで素敵だ"
"Yuna doesn't say anything about Sotnikova. She just said, Gold medal went round to someone who is eagar for Gold medal. She never got mad at Sotnikova or unreasonable judgement. She only focus on the another figure skating atheletes in korea. (Also she donates 5 million dollar as of 2022.)
This is the queen's dignity.
how about Sotnikova? she always speaks ill of Yuna all the time. shameless.
So don't compare to Sotnikova with Yuna."
"Gracie gold bronze medal, kostner silver and yuna’s gold"
"Name a women single skater who can skated to the music better than Yuna Kim

Because I don't see anyone can beat this musicality 

this is the highest leve artistic musical program for a single women skating I've ever seen"
EVEN IN 2023 WE STILL WANT JUSTICE FOR YUNA KIM!
"結婚おめでとうございます❤️
心より祝福します、お幸せに！
今年一番の嬉しい出来事です。"
결혼 축하드려요!! 오래오래 행복하세요!!!🥲
this performance is still deserving of gold idgaf she should've
The true winner. Long live Queen Yuna ❤ the whole world knows the truth
"여전히 경기를 또 보고 또 찾아봐요
단순히 피겨를 본다기 보다 삶에 대한 인사이트를 얻는거 같아요"
"Yuna always scored lower than her ability in all international competitions. Because Korea is not a figure skating powerhouse. What if she was Japanese or Russian? They wouldn't have given her an unfair score. Yuna scored below her level in every international competition, but she never mentioned or complained about it. But in the end, it breaks my heart that she got an unfair score in her last retirement game. She cried after the Sochi Olympics. She said she cried not because she didn't win the gold medal, but because it was all over. It is still sad to think of the many absurdities and injustices she experienced during her career. It makes me sadder that she never complained about absurdity. Yuna is a legend of legend
(Yuna's words) (Yuna is famous for jumping very accurately)
Interviewer: What do you think of the other players' wrong jumps?
Yuna: Just because it's a wrong jump, it's never an easy jump. Please don't think it's too bad."
She is queen
Фантастическая фигуристка! Неземная. Это ее золото
"I think she knew after the extreme jump in the short program's score for Adelina what the judges were going to do after the free. Adelina should have placed 4th at best, Yuna, Caro and Gracie were severely robbed of their true podium placements. And, while I preferred the programs from Mao and Caro at Sochi, Yuna still has that element of skating skills so insane she makes jumps look completely effortless."
"It's 2023, but still I cannot get the result. It's such a shame that Yuna's last competitive performance was done in Russia."
Speechless. Amazing.
Ah yes after yuna’s beautiful skating was the moment figure skating died
watching in 2024 :)
"Мына керемет қадам жолдарына үшінші деңгей берген не деген генийлер? What ""geniuses"" gave the Level 3 to this masterpiece of step sequence?"
for me she is the winner............. she might be upset that she didnt got the gold.........thinking that make me feel sad
"Quando me lembro da patinação no gelo, só um nome vem a memória: Yuna Kim. Ela sempre será o sinônimo desse esporte."
"It's been nine years, but.. It still hurts my heart and I will be heartbroken forever.. a player who didn't even make it to the podium in a major tournament.. gold medalist?.."
Its 2025 & I am still here to watch her performance...
"Now people, that’s what I call a robbery in a broad daylight. Petition for Yunas medal reallocation!!!"
Such shame she has retired... Our world needs the Queen back...
피겨야말로 AI심판이 무조건 도입되어야 할 종목
1:47 Yuna's skills are phenominal and 7:14 I and many are still confused how she didn't win the Gold medal...
"Как же она мне нравилась ❤такая лёгкая, одно наслаждение смотреть как она катается"
10 years anniversary today!!!
ユナはこのプログラムが一番好きだなー。妖艶な感じが似合う。
진짜 이땐 무슨 스케이터 신 느낌이었음 그 압박속에서 어떻게 이렇게 완벽히 연기한건지 대단함..
di dalam hatiku pemenang sesungguhnya kim yuna
True winner 🏆 Also her dress is so pretty 😍
12 days till 2025 and still bitter about this
her real score should have been 155 points. Sotnikova's score should just have been 128 Points. more not.
"Хочется, чтобы это видео побыстрее набрало 10 миллионов просмотров 💜"
"IOC 너네들은 이거 올리면서 부끄럽지 않냐 진짜..
발리예바 도핑 때문에 열 받고 와서 정화 하고 간다"
"Today is 9th February, 2024, and it's already the 7th or even the 10th time I watch this performance again and again. It's absolutely amazing and captivating!"
"피겨의 본질= 빙상의 예술
그 120%를 보여준 21세기 거의 유일한 선수"
Yuna is all time legend.
진짜 연기가 금메달 그 이상 초월의 예술경지다
The true gold medalist
You're watching Sochi Olympics women's gold medallist.
"Don’t know which one I like more, this or her Vancouver FS. I really can’t put into words how much her skating means to me, the artistry is just top-notch and she has technical perfection unlike the pyrite medalist.

Send the Clowns or Les Miserables are definitely my absolute favorites from her though ❤

Edit: Actually, after watching this again for like ten times, this is probably my favorite performance of hers ❤️

Edit Edit: I can’t decide between Send in the Clowns and Adios Nonino, they’re both just so perfect in every way 💕

Edit Edit Edit: Okay, but Les Miserables is just so magnificent in a way that I literally cannot comprehend how it wasn’t the world record 😭"
"Just watched Adelina's free skate in slow mo. There is no choreo there, she just randomly moved her arm somewhere... In the other hand, this Masterpiece, choreographed by David Wilson and executed by Queen Yuna, is full of choreography! Yet Adelina got more points in choreography than Yuna..."
"実質的に2度のオリンピック金メダリスト
何度見ても、想いは変わらない🥇🥇"
we know real gold who is.
She is the true winner... She deserves a diamond! Queen Yuna 👑
"The queen she said, and without the gold everyone know who is the real winner. Shame on russia"
Beautiful talented figure skating!  She is so beautiful as well.  She deserves it!❤❤❤❤
1:48~1:52 부분은 보면서 항상 놀람 쫀득하게 너무 잘 표현함
"어릴땐 잘몰랐는데 다 커서 보니까
와 ... 대박이다 그냥 신이였네
경이롭다 그저"
표정 연기조차 완벽한 여왕님 스케이터로서의 그녀가 너무 그립다
Queen Yuna👑
She's the best of the best!
"밴쿠버 거쉰은 잠잘때 틀어놓고 보다가 마지막 스텝부분에 들어가면 기분좋게 잠들수있는데, 이게 지루해서는 전혀 아니고, 그부분이 음악과 김연아 잔상이 남아서 기분좋게 꿈나라로 가고싶을때 보면 좋음. ..이렇게 써놓으니 합법마약같네… 그런데 아디오스 노니노는 완전 반대로 … 보다보면 잠이 절로 깸 프로그램이 쉬는 부분이 전혀없음 보는사람은 즐겁고 슬프고(부모님생각나서…) 거대함에 압도되고 넋놓게 만드는 프로그램이지만 김연아는 연습할때 죽을맛이었을듯 근데 저걸 어떻게 저렇게 쉽게하는지…..그냥 대단할따름"
Two time Olympic champion 👍
what Piazzola and this girls makes everyone feels….. amazing !!!
"OMG Who is Sotnikova and where is she now😂?……….
But Yuna Kim is legend."
"Меня радует, что фигуристку, завершившую карьеру девять лет назад, сравнивают с нынешними звёздами ✊️ А я стала ее фанаткой лишь пять лет назад"
언제봐도 너무 좋은 연느  음악 선정도 언제나 옳다 너무 좋아
step sequence of the ages
"Эта программа не проигрывает Аделине, Вы просто считаете свою фигуристку лучшей 👍🏻"
Is anyone still watching this in October 2024? Me
"속상해서 항상 안봤는데 동계청소년올림픽
피겨보면서 김연아의 대단함을 다시한번느껴본다."
this is beautiful she might be my second fav skater.
Long live the Queen ✨️
Real Champion Queen Yuna 👏
A beautiful and emotive rendition of art on ice🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
2:06 and 4:10 those transitions make it seem like the musical piece was written after this performance
She is GOAT
"完璧だわ。
浅田真央が勝てる相手じゃねぇわ。
日本の狂信者たちよ、いい加減日本のイメージを下げなさい。
すべての国はキムヨナの演技は世界最高だと認めています。「日本だけ除いて」
もう自分の国が絶対勝たないといけないという情けない思考は捨てましょう"
HBD to The Queen 🎉
Her expressions are amazing
It’s officially 10 years later and I’m still pissed.
_Long live the Queen_
다시봐도 감동의연기!!! 이 경기를 본사람은 누가 금메달인지 알것이다!!!
"Never forget the caption change! The original caption was, “Yuna Kim wins silver with a superb performance”!"
The musicality is unmatched!!!
"Some says we should move on and deal with it. Time has passed. But NO. It's not the end and it's not over at all. Look at Russians in this olympics. Doping issues and abusing little girls with harsh training but still get to do their performance. We should do something about this. We can't just move on. IOC, ISU, and Russia Please! Russians! Wake up and Listen to the world!!"
True Winner 🏆
"2024년 연말에 또 보게된다.
정말 완성도 높은 피겨를 보여
주어 존경을 표합니다..❤❤"

몇번을 봐도 멋있다
Watching her to cleanse myself of Beijing 2022 Olympics. Yuna is still the best female figure skater
2025년 첫날 이거 보면서 우는 사람 나야나ㅜ
"Восхитительная пластика, грация, слияние с музыкой. Первое место, безусловно за ней."
"Even to untrained eyes, she should have won the gold, I honestly don't know what more she could have done, that was one of her best skates. That being said, Adelina was just a teenager used by the corrupted system, let's not drag her through the mud."
She is perfect i can't understand why she got the silver medal
"キムヨナさんの魅せ方存在感素晴らしい！
伝説のスケーターですね！"
*THE QUEEN.*
10 years later and I’m still bitter about her not winning gold.
"I don’t know were she is but if she see this I ben seeing this performance for 10 years, and from I was a kid I remember her name and I get in love to skating because of this, I remember the first time I see it and think, OMG she got everything of this piazzola tango, the best performance I ever see in skate an in everything just wow"
전세계인이 연아가 금메달이라는걸 말해줌 ㅋ
"Although I'm Russian... Yuna skates better than Adelina, there were Russian judges there and they wanted a medal for the Russians. Yuna is the best!"
전 이걸 볼 때 아직도 소트니코바가 금메달 딴 게 이해가 안 됩니다 진정한 금메달리스트는 김연아 선수입니다 역시 우아하면서도 기품있는 연기를 보여줬네요
Her dance marks the end of the artistry of figure skating and marks the beginning of the circus era
YUNA IS THE BEST ❄️❤️
"Stolen by russia! 
Yoona is the ice queen!"
"2014년 연아선수의 쇼트 가 끝나고 아..프리에서 클린을 하더라도 제대로된 점수는 받기힘들겠구나  러샤 선수 누구든 겉클린만해라 기필코 러샤모가지에 금걸어주겠구나 작정한걸 느끼고 연아선수가 클린해도 제대로된 점수를 못받는걸 생방송으로 지켜볼 자신이없어 못보고 지금껏 9년동안 봉인했던 프리 프로그램을 보고말았다,.나는 이제야 연아선수를 놓아주었다..고생했어요. 사랑합니다."
The Queen!!!
YUNA KIMS ERAS LA CAMPEONA CREETELO Y T MEDALLA DE ORO LO TENDRAD EN TU CORAZON QUE VALE MAS QUE EL ORO
I still watch this and still feel pissed off.
The most troubling to me is that she didn’t even seem surprised
What beautiful musicality and interpretation 🌈💙🎶🕊
"As a person who loved this sport,
Hating Russian political issues and the IOC for not keeping and respecting sportsmanship for athletes who spent more than four years trying for the Olympics.
It's been almost 10years, but I can't watch this phenomenal program rightly"
"У Ёна высокие прыжки! Думаю 40 сантиметров в высоту точно будут ❤ Те, кто пишет, что у Ёна низкие прыжки, просто ей завидуют или не хотят видеть её хорошие качества"
I miss her...
きれいですよね、キム・ヨナさん。好きですよ。
THE QUEEN
"Silver like this hurts all life. Baby, your gold was stolen 😢"
That was incredible. Like I’m in awe

Yuna Kim is Amazing!!!
끝나고 해설진이 ‘아디오스 김연아’ 할 때 눈물 좔좔.. 지금봐도 정말 감동이에요..🥺
Queen of the world
Even the commentator says ^FUNNY feeling^ that Sot's gonna win.
"당시 생중계로 보고 너무 속상한 마음에 다시 못본 프로그램이네요 8년동안이나
그도안 연아선수의 다른 프로그램만 줄창 보다가 용기를 내서 다시 보니 그 긴 시간을 왜 낭비했나싶네요
이 아름답고 우아한 프로그램을 왜 그동안 즐기지 못했을까 
앞으로라도 마르고 닳도록 봐야겠네요
너무 아름답고 우아한 완벽한 프로그램입니다"
엔딩장면 필사적으로 안보여주려고 옆에서 찍는거 개웃기네 ㅋㅋ
i need a drama about her so badly
김연아 선수님은 진정한 금메달리스트다.  ❤
BRUUHHHH IM STILL MAD TO THIS DAYY!!! HOW DID SHE NOT WIN 😫😫
"10 years later, I’m still bitter about her getting second……"
Long live the queen!!!
How to begin 2024 is the most beautiful and extatic way :
"Можно смотреть бесконечно!!!Юна, спасибо за красивое выступление ❤❤❤❤❤"
She is so graceful
댓글수를 보더라도 그날 소치에서 연아선수 퍼포먼스를 본 사람들은 누가  참피언인지 다들 알고계신듯 합니다 우리나라에 보물같은 선수 김연아 감사합니다
✨🥇Long live the Queen🥇✨
Real Queen
Women single figure skating has already died since SOCHI 2014.
You don’t need to slow the video to see the jump edges… It is 2024 and I’m still not over it. What a shame for judges…
"5:58 울음이 나올뻔했지만 참는 모습이 너무 울컥하당,,,"
"Too much time has passed since 2014, but as a fan it was hard I'm enjoying it now as 2022. Her nonino is amazing the more you know about it😍😍 I think it's the best because it contains tango moves Even in figure skating, there were many players who just mimic tango like modern dance. She's got her movements perfect, even 'Roxanne's Tango' I love it As the haters say I think it means she's better than the player she likes anyway It's stupid to say 'who brings new players and who is better than Yuna Kim'. Haters increase the number of views of Yuna Kim's video, As a fan of Yuna Kim, thank you~~~"
"아디오스 노니노..... 진짜 아름답다.....
명곡을 휘감아서 지배해버리는 퀸연아..."
"Triunfo que le fue robado en Sochi pasa a la historia como un oro robado, la historia se lo debe."
Yuna Kim & Yuzuru Hanyu .. the best of the best 💗
10 years later and I’m still bitter about her not winning gold 🥇 🤦🏻‍♂️
"이날의 진정한 승자가 누군지는 그녀의 커리어가 증명 할 것 이며, 진정한 피겨팬이라면 누구든 알 수 있음
그랜드슬램 & 올포디움 유나킴❤"
10 years later and I’m still bitter about her not winning gold ……
나 또 왔어... 돌고돌아 여기구나..
시간이 흐를수록 그녀의 가치는 더욱 빛이난다.
3:05 음악에 맞춰서 움직이는거 쾌감 미쳤당
진짜… 여왕의 품격이 느껴지는 스케이팅이십니다. 아름답고 우아하고 격조있고 무게가 있었으며 쎅씨함까지 있네여~
"솔직히 이미 금메달을 얻은 김연아에게 또다른 금메달은 크게 의미 없었을 거다. 물론 하나 더 얻는다면 좋았겠지만 2010년 벤쿠버 올림픽에서 이미 그녀는 자신이 당대 피겨의 여왕임을 전세계 증명했고, NBC 캐스터였던 톰 해먼드의 ""The coronation is complete. Long live the Queen!""라는 멘트로 세계구급 인증을 해줬다. 그 이후에도 세계선수권 대회에서 여러 메달을 추가로 획득하며 '원-히트-원더'가 아님을 보여줬다.

그리고 2014년 피겨 금메달? 솔직히 이제 누가 기억하지?"
i have seen this so many times
yuna’s better than me because if i had a clean performance with textbook technique and lost to ADELINA SOTNIKOVA i’d be throwing hands
Anyone remembers the gold medalist's performance?
금메달은 김연아🥇🥇
Just The World Best
Oh... The Queen!!!
연아프로그램을  모두  너무너무  좋아하는데  이건  이상하게  마음이  아파  꺼내보지  못하다  이제야  다시  본다

This is a truely masterpiece. I just don't like the way the commentators say about yuna's performance.. I don't think these British commentators are so professional.
Queen ✨
2024년 다시 보는데 눈물이 나네
It's funny how in 2018 Russians wanted Evgenia and in 2022 they wanted Kamila to win gold but both of the times their favorite skater didn't win olympics. The unfair win of Sotnikova lead to all of this
Brilliant yuna kim...we loveyou philippines

"So heartbreaking. Almost 10 years have past but cant enjoy this performance with 100% joy. This moment was beginnig of Russian ruining woman figure skating. Drug, pop and retire"
only she deserves gold
Gold medal is her.
she deserved the gold medal. it was the most embarrassing night of the olympic games.
Skating Skills is 10/10
The true queen ✨💕
Can we have a drama about her? 🥺
올림픽 정신을 지킨 연아가 대단하다. 결과에 승복하고 덤덤하게 그리고 갈라에서 보여준 이것이 진정한 올림픽 그리고 우리가 지금 살아가면서 지켜야하는 평화. 그것을 러시아에서 하였다.

3:56 이때부터 그냥 소름돋고 눈물남
우리들의 영원한 여왕
"Вот русские пишут что у Сотниковой программа была сложнее, бла-бла. Но а) она не делала сольный лутц ни в короткой ни в произвольной и б) она сделала первым прыжком в каскаде в КП самый простой из шести прыжков - тулуп, знатоки вы эдакие. В дорожке она в сезоне получала третий уровень, даже во вращениях получала второй-третий. В компонентах в ПП ни разу до Сочи не получала 70. И вишенка на торте - обнялась с судьёй, женой президента ФФКР Аллой Викторовной 😂😂😂😂"
My olympic champion
완벽함. 더 필요한 말이 없음. 소치 올림픽이 김연아의 격에 맞지 않았음.
아디오스 노니노는 마지막에 진짜 전율이 일어남
"스스, 프젠, 점프 도입, 엣지, 랜딩 다 김연아가 압살임ㅋㅋ 소트니코바가 낫다는 애들은 눈을 뜨고 피겨를 봤으면^^"
We will never forget how they robbed you of your gold medal
위대한 여정의 마지막을 장식하기에 더 없이 완벽한 프로그램이었다고 생각합니다 예술의 경지에 오른 어나더 레벨의 작품❤ 넋을 놓고 보게됨 😮
Figure skating dead in Sochi that day.
Even though she didn't get the gold. Queen Yuna will forever be a legendary figure skater. I feel she inspire so many young girls to participate on ice. She also got to take Misha Jr home.
Real real champion🎉
전설의 예술작품을 남김 금의 가치 위에 김연아가 있다는걸 증명함
"Әттең, мен төреші емеспін, әйтпесе компоненттеріне мынадай ұпай беретін едім: 
Skating skills 10.00
Transitions 9.50
Performance 10.00
Choreography 10.00
Interpretation 10.00 
1.6 коэффициентке көбейткенде 79.20 ұпай болар еді"
"キム·ヨナとコ·ウリムは元々昨年結婚したがっていたが、コロナのせいで結婚式が延期されたという噂もある。
 今よりもっと早く結婚したかったことを見ればそれほどお互いに信頼して愛しているのです。"
Queen Yuna
Queen ❤️
"SURE, AMAZING"
"Ёнаның конькиі музыкалық аспап сияқты ғой, шіркін! Маэстро-Патшайым! Осы бағдарламаны сүйем ғой! Сізді қатты жақсы көреміз, Патшайым! ❤❤❤"
hello again queen yuna!
아름답다... 허나 끝까지 보기 힘들다.. 너무 속상하다..ㅜㅠ
Gold was truly hers..too bad!  Stolen..she will always be the winner.
"Орыстар, айтыңыздаршы, неге Ёнаны сонша ұнатпайсыздар? Ол марапаттау рәсімінде Аделинаны құшақтап, құттықтаған, қазіргі қыздардың керемет техникалық мүмкіндіктеріне таңданысын білдірген. Тіпті оның жолдасы (күйеуі) орыс тілінде де ән айтады! She doesn't deserve all that hate from you, Russians... 😔"
Queen yuna
"Great artistry sense;
Gli ""appoggi""  after the technical execution are wonderful, effortless as as great dancer should be!"
"“Technicality this wasn’t a match for sotinikova” - male commentator

Clearly you’re delusional for thinking that a flutz and horrible take offs can surpass yuna’s textbook techniques"
"7:37 two coaches be like ""we knew that they won't give gold by any chance"""
She conveyed something unique
진짜 신의 은총이 맞다..
동작하나하나가 경기가아니라 예술입니다
perfect!!! elegant!!!
김연아가 올림픽에 나와 스케이트타는 걸 다시 보고 싶어...그립다ㅜ
연아야 행복해
"After seeing the figure skating stained with drugs, I came to purify my eyes."
The Queen
Queen yuna💙💙💙
Что можно ожидать больше золотого медалиста я её фанатка
We all think that Yuna is queen and deserved gold except of stupid Russia lol
"연아야!  부끄러워 하지마!
네가 챔피언 이야."
I love how the female caster is so done with the male caster when discussing who would get the gold
musical goddess
hi my queen yuna
Wonderful Interpretation
Absolutely sounds like the commentators were in the know ahead of time
So different from today's skating..
"진짜 맨날보는거지만 플립 장난아니다,,"
"How she got the Silver is beyond me, even after that performance to think she was ahead of the short program, 8 years later and after that Beijing competition, I think people know WHO won that game."
MY Queen 😭
QUEEN
The last great skate to happen at the Olympics.
Gold performance
still not over this
"김연아 존재 자체가 피겨여왕이기 때문에 메달 색깔은 상관없음. 이렇게 영상으로 불후의 명작이 남아있는데, 누가 이걸 보고 소트니코바가 김연아보다 잘해서 금메달을 받았다고 진심으로 그렇게 생각하겠음? 단, 올림픽이 정치 선전에 이용되는 추악한 도구로 전락하지 않고, 세계의 평화를 기원하고 모두에게 공정한 축제로 남으려면 언젠가 김연아에게 금메달을 돌려줘야하지 않을까 싶음. 소치 올림픽에서 올림픽이  푸틴의 정치 선전 도구로 타락하고, 베이징 올림픽에서 푸틴은 올림픽 기간동안 평화를 유지한다는 올림픽 약속을 훼손해서 화가남."
Given only level 3? can they make distortions any more obvious?
Are we finally getting our 🥇 back ? Are We ??
キム・ヨナ大好き
이 연기가 금메달이 아니라고 주장할라치면 최소 국수주의자인 러시아인이어야하고 결백하지 않은 성격에 피겨에 문외한이어야 한다는 조건이 붙는다 시간이 흐를 수록 결국 모두가 알 것이다 진짜 골드빛 연기를 한 선수가 누구인지를
Art itself
Long Live the Queen~~!!😍
3:20 I just remember to breathe
Ladies Figure Skating died when Yuna Kim didn’t get the gold she deserved
"이 연기를 하고 은메달을 받았으면 그에 응당한 훌륭한 금메달 연기가 있었어야 했는데 현실은 도핑한 것이 거의 확실했던, 그럼에도 불구하고 실수투성이 연기를 한 유사국가의 유사선수가 금메달을 가져갔으니 소치 올림픽은 과연 누굴 위한 올림픽이었나 싶다. 😢😢"
"After that,she did not compete back again.glad she's now Korea's top female richest celebrity"
I'm wondering how much score she could get if the game was fair
Queen 👑
"Michelle kwan is a legend,  Yuna is another."
진정한 금메달 ❤
最后的探戈😭永远的女王😭
GOAT
연느 경기보고 연느랑 아이유가 부른 얼음꽃 들으면 진짜 소름 돋아요 😭

The queen of ice
Beautiful 😊

"Төрешілер Аделинаның, Каролинаның, Маоның қадам жолдарына төртінші деңгей мен керемет GOE беріп, Ёнаның қадам жолдарын үшінші деңгеймен, тым төмен GOE-мен бағалаған! 😭"
"These days, there is no real queen, and the drug-addicted Russian's Podium makes me sad."
옛날에 해설 번역해서 올린사람 영상만 아니었어도 이 영상 조회수가 리프니츠카야보다 높았을텐데 아쉽네
Top tier
"Remember, No Russian."
"個人的にはバンクーバーよりもソチのFSの方が好きだった。

全力を尽くしたからなのか、これが引退前の最後の演技だからなのかはわからないけど、演技終了後の笑顔がどことなく寂しそうな感じにも見えた。

彼女の3-3も好きだったけれど、他の選手にはない哀愁ある表現が素晴らしいね。"
김연아 최고
"Какая умничка, как красиво все исполнено, жаль, что бывает так в жизни..."
아디오스 노니노라서 더 가슴아팠던..
our queen!
QUEEN ✨✨
yuna ❤
She is married now ;)
Beautiful performance ❤ the legendary ice queen indeed
It’s been 10 years and I still think of this incredible performance. Guess everything in the world really is politics. Hilarious bc the other girl said “politics should never be involved” in 2024 ban appeal 😂 clearly fine with politics letting her win in 2014. This will always be a legendary performance on its own.
"Красивое катание и высокие, пролётные прыжки. Прекрасное танго в постановке Маэстро Дэвида Уилсона. Этой девочке 33 годиков) На момент Олимпиады в Сочи было 23)"
벌써 10년 전이라니... 4년 전 같은데.... 😢 그리워
"It’s 2023, still upset that she didn’t get gold. Completely robbed 😢"
아직도 너무 좋다
"Она прямо парит надо льдом, вот это я понимаю - мастерство!"
Әдемі жұпты құттықтаймын! Патшайымымыз бақытты болсын! 🎉💖💍👰
LEGEND
"Reflect on yourselves, referees.
Is this concert silver? Either your eyes are rotten or you've been paid for life.
No matter how new the world record is, Kim Yuna...
I can't believe he ruined his third consecutive Olympic gold medal."
"Наткнулась на комментарий одного человека и сравнила общую базовую стоимость вращений Ёна и Аделины. В короткой программе у них разница лишь 0.3 балла, а в произвольной - одинаково. Получается, во вращениях у них лишь 0.3 балла разница. На дорожках шагов в обеих программах Ёна должна была получить четвёртый уровень. В короткой Аделина прыгнула каскад из двух тройных тулупов, а Ёна - из тройных лутца и тулупа. За две программы Ёна сделала три лутца и два флипа, а Аделина - один лутц, три флипа и риттбергер (если сложить всё и сравнить, разница будет 2.20, в пользу Ёна) . И в компонентах разница за обе программы была меньше полбалла..."
"Ёна өз ұпайын күтіп отырғанда көрерменнің ""Ресей!"" деп айғайлағаны дұрыс емес!"
참 이쁘다.그저 자기 할 일을 했을 뿐이라는 그 담담한 성정도.(사회에서 자기 할 일을 제대로 안했기에 탈 나는 경우가 허다한데) 그래서 더 빛난다.겸손해야지하는 다짐을 하며 스스로를 낮추려 조절하기 이전에 타고나길 우쭐댐이 없는 본성인거 같다.
on top of the list. ❤❤❤❤
연아언니 사랑해
The requiem for figure skating.
"아름답다,
그녀의 피겨 인생에서 최고의 경기 였음을 부인할 수 없다,
언제든지 꺼내볼 수 있는 세상이라서 행복하다,"
That Lutz edge at the beginning😭🙌🏼
She was supposed to be much beyond the champion! Such a shame judging scandal on Olympic Games!
발레리나 같다~ 너무 아름답다
"""One little error for Sotnikova""
You can really tell when sports commentators know next to nothing about the sport they're meant to be commentating on."
Queen Forever ❤❤❤
Высокий класс! Высокое искусство! Браво!
2023 and the feeling is the same: injustice.
love u yuna kim ! fantastis !
Queen!!!!♥️♥️
And u telling me this performance didnt won gold omg
When this hits 10 million views I will 100% throw away my bad habits and addictions
"2022 still,"
"Разница в базе у Сотниковой и Ёна за две программы была 2.94. За произвольную 3.94. Это при том, что ""порезали"" уровни на дорожке шагов Ёна в обеих программах а Сотниковой, наоборот, повысили. Например, на Чемпионате Европы за месяц до Сочи Сотникова за дорожку в обеих программах получила третий уровень. А так разница в базе у них была бы вообще смехотворной - полбалла! Даже если обеим поставили бы четвертый уровень, разница бы была 1.74. Про ""недокрут на лутце"" можете не писать, у Сотниковой тоже несколько недокрутов было, которые она ""выразительно"" обыграла, подняв свободную ногу. Так что, ""дорогие"", можете не писать про ""четыре балла разницы"" 😂 И это только про элементы я говорю. А компоненты... За одиннадцать месяцев до этого разница между ними была 13 баллов, а в Сочи - о, чудо! - девять сотых! Девять. Сотых. Такой колоссальный ""скачок"" ещё можно было бы понять, если бы Сотникова в Олимпийском сезоне проводила победный сезон как Алина например, выиграв и этапы Гран-при, и финал серии, и чемпионат Европы. Но нет. На этапах Гран-при у неё серебро и бронза, в финале - 5 место, и на ЧЕ - серебро, как и в 2013. Она до Сочи в произвольной и 70 баллов за компоненты в произвольной ни разу не набирала, если не ошибаюсь. Это судьи в составе которых была Алла Викторовна, супруга президента ФФКР и техбригада во главе с Александром Рафаэлевичем сделали так, чтобы домашняя фигуристка ""победила"". Так что, с вашего не позволения, буду продолжать называть Ёна двукратной Олимпийской чемпионкой. Смешно, что некоторые считают себя умнее Олимпийской чемпионки и двукратной чемпионки мира 😂 ""Дорогие"", вы что, думаете что она с хореографом непродуманно ставили программы? 😂"
The day figure skating died
"The commentators are talking out of their asses, were they bought as well? :) Were we watching the same performance even? Them saying Sotnikova was better than Yuna? Are you kidding me?"
ㅠㅠ 피겨여신 연느님 계속 봐도 아름다운..
4바퀴는 분명 훈련과 고난이 필요한 존중받아야할 기술. 하지만 반드시 더 아름다운지 모르겠다. 연아의 자연스럽고 우아한 더블이 다른 선수들의 4바퀴보다도 예뻐..
im still mad
Here again
"Pure Russians, some of them commenting here put some drugs in their brains like their champions did.🥰🥰"
The essential of Russian figure- skating = 💉💊
모두가 알지. 이 해프닝은 진짜를 돋보이게 했을뿐
"The moment she step of the ice. 

The moment the sport died"

"such a robbery. i saw the program that won gold, it was not better than this."

They should have banned all of Russia in Sochi.

"a decade later, still salty she didn’t get gold for this."
Это просто шедевр!!
真央ちゃんの天真爛漫な演技にはない妖艶さがある色気たっぷり
"The judges and technical panel, who robbed Yuna on step sequence in free skate alone by 1.5 points <<<<<<< 👎👎👎👎👎👎"
Каролина мен Маоны жек көрем.  Ұятсыз төрешілер Ёна Патшайымның қадам жолдарына төртінші деңгей мен 1.70 GOE (кемінде) беруі керек еді!
11 years and still bitter that she didn't win the gold...
Real queen yuna 💜🩷
"キムヨナさんのいないフィギュアは、
つまらないですね。王者はどこにもいません。女王と呼べるのはキムヨナだけ🌹"

IM FROM RUSSIA AND I HATE THAT THEY PUT SOTNIKOVA FIRST. NOT FAIR. купленные судьи
어쩌면..금을 찾아올지도…
Yuna Kim Perfact in my opinion… where ‘s the gold? I’m very sad … the last perfomance. Please be a fair judge
ES INCREÍBLE!!!!
where is the thief now?
곧 조회수천만
마지막 딴 딴 딴 할때 눈물이 난다 ㅠㅠ
Amazing!
주기적으로 보는 영상 ❤
소트니코바 갈라쇼보면 소트니가 금메달딸 실력이 절대 아니었다는걸 알게됨
WHAT DID I JUST HEAR AT 5:27 ???
Oh the queen😊
Аделинаға берілген 149.95 ұпай - ағымдағы әлем және Олимпиада чемпионына жасалған қиянат! (Ёна 2013 жылғы әлем чемпионатында еркін бағдарлама үшін 148.34 ұпай алған)👎 Өте ұят нәрсе!
best ever！
7:13 Listen to that. They knew it was coming. Even Yuna knew
🌹🌹🌹🌹🎇💥✨💕🌈💐🦚💘🍀🔥🎆퀸연아 사랑해요💕💕💕💕🥰
"Yuna deserved gold tbh, Sotnikova skates with no emotion imo"
올포디움의 전설 김연아
lol what a joke that she got 2nd here.  10 years later I’m still 😡
"Ёна жеңіс үшін шамасы жеткеннің бәрін жасаған, бірақ Аделинаға төрешілердің берген ұпайы - нағыз абсурд!"
This performance should be judged to be that of the winner.
"Классная, изящная Ким Юна. Таже самая ситуация была в 2002 году на олимпиаде"
ㅎㅎ흐믓한 얼굴로 바라보는 시선이 아름 답 습니다~❤멎지다 퀸연아~❤
"Halfway thru 2024 and still bitter about this haha, she really got robbed"
우아 1000 만회
"キム·ヨナの実姉は看護師ですが、2015年に医師と結婚し、現在はアメリカに移住して暮らしています。
そのため、キム·ヨナの兄夫が医師だということだ。
現在韓国に住んでいるキムヨナの両親のそばにはヨナだけなのにコウリムを大好きです。
息子のいない家にとても優しくて心強い婿が入ってきたと。"
"Russia drug addict, only one queen yuna"
당시 고등학생 시절이었던 나는 김연아 선수가 금메달을 목에 걸지 못한게 분노가 치밀어서 눈물이 날 정도였는데 지금 다시 보니 진정한 승리자는 김연아 선수고 메달의 가치는 당시 그녀에게 있어서 더 이상 중요하지 않았던걸 깨달았다 그래도 개빡치네
"10년이 지나도 열받네.. 
도둑맞은 연아 선수의 금메달"
Sotnikova should be stripped of her gold medal for doping
A sheep surrounded with wolves.
Paso a ver el video para enojarme de vuelta porque no ganó
"Некоторые прыжки Юны лучше не бывает ! Но как же эта программа проигрывает Аделине..  это так очевидно...нет никаких сомнений: только изумительное выступление, программа  Аделины достойны золота ."
"Yuna seems like she knew before hand that she won't win at Sochi
During her performance in 2010 at Vancouver
She felt her winning moment

She knew she gave a better performance than Adelina, but she seems she knew that it was already pre determined that Adelina will win cuz you know she was over scored"
Very nice
아 지금봐도 소름돋는다 독보적인 예술성.. 엿같은 형광나방…하…. 러시아는 이정도면 창피해서라도 피겨 하지 말아야지
똥트니코바 연기보다가 김연아 연기보니까 다시봐도 압도적인 실력으로 김연아 금메달이다
I wonder what broadcast this clip is from. I think the commentators were truly outspoken and fearless
리얼퀸❤
The Qeen
Юна супер❤❤❤❤❤
지금 다들 3-3 뛴다해도 김연아같은 파워풀함은 안느껴짐 ㄷㄷ
Hail to the Queen!
"왜 올림픽 채널에서 영국 유로스포츠 해설을 올렸을까?!
음.. 자기들 추억한 짓을 감추기 위함. 이 해설에서 소트니코바가 테크니컬점수가 더 높다며 주절 하는것을 마치 그래서 솥뚜껑이 금메달 땄다고 하는듯.
롱엣지 비틀랜딩 두발렌딩 은 언급도 없음. 예술점수 ! 비교가 되나? 거칠고 우악스런 안무에 수행."
러시아가 피겨를 망쳐놨어
Exquisite queen

퀸연아
어떻게 이렇게 깔끔하고 아름다운 경기를 두고 나방뇬이 금메달을 땄는지 아직도 의문이다~
올림픽 채널은 이 영상을 오오리일 자아겨어기 읍따
The performance is run-of-the-mill.
my lover💖💖💖💋💋💋🛐🛐🛐🆒
6:43 What were they shouting?
10년이나 됐다고??!?!??!?!
Она должна была заработать золото
러시아가 망친 피겨의 시작.. 두고두고 화자될듯

Altă tânără talentată
she was robbed
もうすぐ10年だわ❗️
해설위원 분들도 소트니나방년이 연느한테 상대도 안됐다고 말하는데 심사위원들은••• 안쪽팔리나..?
"Спасибо дядечке Саше и тётушке Аллочке, что подарили Сотниковой золото 😊😊😊😊 Не притворяйтесь, что только одна судья из России была, она имела влияние на всех судей, ещё и потому что была женой президента ФФКР. А Лакерник был техконтролёром. И судьи нарисовали Сотниковой баллы, которые она и во сне не видела. И эти крики трибун ""Рос-си-я!"" Что это, если не неуважение? Вы хоть спасибо скажите что вас пустили на арену Каннына с флагами несмотря на то, что вы натворили в Сочи! Ещё и Аделина этим летом что-то про допинг говорила, что у неё должен был быть суд по допингу. Спокойно так сказала, зная что ей ничего за это не будет. Вы кричите, мол, все против русских, но МОК отклонил жалобу корейской федерации и тогда, в 2014 и в июле, после интервью Аделины!"
"Русские оправдывают свою девочку тем что у нее база была выше. Я только сейчас проверила. Оказывается у Мао база была выше на 5+ балла, чем у Аделины. Мао Асаде судьи поставили два недокрута. Но приземления у неё были почти такие же как у Аделины..."
"Does anyone else wish the commentators would just shut up.  I mean, I get that's what they're paid for.  Bu sometimes it's just - let us have the peformance & you comment *after* please 🙏!"
Road to 10 Million views ❤
이경기를 지켜보던 러시아스케이터는 베이징올림픽에 나갔고 보기좋게 불명예스러운 결말을..

"Наоборот, она должна была победить именно произвольной! Да это же настоящий шедевр! Ох, Дэвид Уилсон! Какой же гений! Какую программу поставил! Достойную всех 80 баллов в компонентах! Не смешите меня, считая что программа Сотниковой была лучше шедевра Ён А 😄
Білгенін істеген ғой Шеховцова бастаған төрешілер, қазақша айтқанда 😂 Стыдно должно быть. Это позор. У Мао Асада восемь тройных было, включая триксель, риттовый 3-3 с флипом, не говоря о вращениях все четвёртого уровня и о замечательной дорожке шагов тоже четвёртого уровня. Но за элементы она получила на два балла меньше чем Сотникова. Все компоненты были у Мао высочайшего уровня, но она получила 69, а Сотникова 74 😂😂😂😂😂"
"if your friends ever wonder why so many young girls doing OF, just show them this non-gold medal performance."
퀀연아의 금메달을 내놓아라 이놈들아😂
What a f-ing robbery
"This is the exact moment in history of figure skating when the standards that Yuna Kim set dropped really low for the next 2 olympic cycles (I'm talking about proclaiming winners whit poopy, flutzy technique like Sotnikova, Međja, Zagitova, Kamila and other toddlers)."
"И вообще. Это Аделина упростила свой контент на Олимпиаде. В сезоне она пробовала 3Lz3Lo в КП, или в ПП или в обеих, не помню"
Катание супер
👍❤️❤️
Could anyone tell me what the female commentator is saying at 3:15 ?
Непревзойденная! Никогда!
"Don't know too much about FS, but this reminds me of Tara vs Michelle way back then. Technicality vs artistry. I remember Michelle had a longer career, a strong artistry, but Tara did a four turn jump which was unheard of, and it won her the Olympics gold."
점수 발표하고나서 코치 두분끼리 눈마주치고 고개 끄덕거리는거 보면 애초에 메달주인은 정해져있던듯
김연아 짱 ♡
She was robbed
Супер❤❤❤❤❤
"И никакой истерики, что ей не досталось золото. Хотя она его более, чем достойна. Она была лучшей на этих играх 🩷 1 место одно, каждый спортсмен это должен понимать"
What does she say at 6:34? She thinks she'll get the what?
Sotnikova got overscored appx by 6points at minimum.
"So now on, it has proven all plan was russia's..
Even now . .the most tragedy is russia they still keep doing it and ruins so much talented genius figure genius. ."
2:55
금메달은 돌아올겁니다
The day that figure skating died.
何か、哀愁だわ。
Adelina doped and that is the best she could come up with? How embarrassing
"でも…やっぱり綺麗だなぁ
色っぽい✨✨"
Зрители снимали со вспышкой... Они делали это специально? Думаю да
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
俄罗斯奥运冠军在拿到2014奥运金牌后直接退役了😂
지금 러시아 보면 벌 제대로 받네 피겨선수들 중 제대로 하는 애 어디있냐? 도핑국 되서 나락 갔지
I love all the Russian skaters but she was robbbbbeddd
❤
"Қымбатты орыстар-ай! Ёнаның бағдарламасының сұлулығын көрмейсіздер, байқамайсыздар. Байқағыларыңыз келмейді 😔"
"Мы: боимся писать плохие комментарии в адрес российских фигуристок, ибо их фанаты сразу же будут бросаться на нас (хотя мне лично русские фигуристки очень нравятся, просто у любого человека есть недостатки!) 
Русские: пишут что попало про Ёна, неприятные вещи в её адрес, зная о безнаказанности! Это разве правильно?"
"Why are the commentators saying the Russian girl was better technically than Yuna, if everyone says it’s obvious she didn’t?"
She was robbed
Who are the casters? Can I know?
약빨로 금메달 딴거잖아 내놔 소트니나방ㅋㅋ
Юна не уступает Камиле🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"I have to point out that the technical score she was given here was 12 points under the 2010 Olympic free skate. 12 POINTS! Maybe she didn't have as much flare as when she skated her absolute best, but to go from 78 to 66 with similar program components is just absurd"
Керемет танго!
❤❤
Does anyone know who the commentators are?
thats some a class bullshit
능력자분들 중 누가 이 영상 해설 좀 달아서 올려줬으면 좋겠음!
sooo robbed!
😭
I watch this pretending that she is the champion
She lowkey looks like the main vocal of IOI
01/01/2025
"Os Russos tiraram na mão grande o bi campeonato da Kim, vergonhoso."
"Судьи: Так, заявленный контент Ким не очень дешевле, так что понизим вручную, поставим третий уровень на дорожке в обеих программах. Гое снижаем на балл-полбалла чем она получила на ЧМ. Не палимся! Сотникова сразу после объявления оценок Ким: палит контору 😂"
9.9m!!!
나 왜 우냐
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤у🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Зачем кричать Россия после проката Юны ?

整形国と言われてるけど綺麗な方が多いですね

"6:34 3Lz should have be under-rotated. Her performance was great, though."
沈んだわ、私。
明日は、忙しい。
負けちゃったじゃないのよ。
This is my opinion but I feel like people should let go of this controversy
悪意が物語っているわ
"Ерунда,а не катание."
Никаких впечатлений. Ноль.
どうしてなのか。
最後かな。これ
"Разница в базе в произвольной у них была 3.97, а не пять, десять или двадцать как некоторые думают. И это просто смешно, что разница между компонентами двух девушек была 0.09 😄 И еще в короткой Аделина прыгнула каскад тулуп-тулуп, а Ёна лутц-тулуп, а по технике Аделина всё же обошла Юну... Аделина молодец, собралась, энергично выдала лучшие прокаты в своей жизни. Но..."
Está de flojera su rutina y muy lenta por eso no gano hasta me aburrió merecido su plata 🤷‍♀️
"There's neither anything special nor wow factor in both Sotnikova and Yuna's skating and jumps. Unlike with Sasha, Anna, Kamila and Kaori. The highest level of ladies figure skating you'll ever see. Kostner was more exciting to watch but was underrated. She was like the original Kostornaia without 3A."
ソチで、銀メダルです❗️
早くしろ
"キムヨナのスケーティング、表現力は成熟された上手さがありますね。
完成度が高く魅了されたのはキムヨナです。
しかし、点数に最も影響のあるJUMPの構成点はアデリナの方が高いです。
トランジッション、ジャンプ前のステップ、スピンなどプログラム全体の難易度はアデリナが上だと思います。
母国開催で大きなミス無く、全ての要素やJUMPをほぼ完璧にこなしたアデリナに有利に働くのは当然の事。
アデリナ優勝で何の不思議も違和感もありません。
ソチのキムヨナは美しかったけど‥勝利は難しかったと思う。"
"I've never watched her rentals, but I heard that she was divorced at the 2014 Olympics. I came to see after she spoke out in the direction of Kamila valieva, I was wondering if she was so great that she could afford such statements. I was upset maybe the points were underestimated, but she's definitely not the queen, there's nothing in her rentals."
来なくて正解よ。
本当にそれでいいの？

皆様が、間違えてしまいます‼️
"Почему все говорят по элегантность и легкость. Где? 

Она пашет, много работает и наверно заслуживает за это какие то награды. 

Но настоящие спектакли, легкость и утонченность у Камилы Валиевой, у Саши Трусовой, у Шербаковой, у Медведевой, у Загитовой. 

Фигурное катание очень изменилось со времен Сочи. Четкого образа и сильного спектакля нет ни у Юны, не у Аделины. Сравните их прокаты с Дон Кихотом Алины 2018 или Анной Карениной Жени 2018. А здесь… Катание под музыку и изредка отсылки к образу. 

В таком положении остается только судить технику. А у Аделины техника выше. Вот и все"
Ей до наших как до луны
"На фоне Ким Сотникова выглядит, как бревно, да простят меня фанаты"
The commentators are so unprofessional!
私に文句いう前にプーチンに言いなさいよ。何なのよ❗️
RinRinとblueskyは、揃って私が誰かと同一人物であると、勝手に設定していますが、別人です。迷惑です。証拠を示して下さい。
Аделина потрясающая спортсменка. У неё заслуженно 1 место. Победитель. Сложная программа у Аделины.
Silver medal hahah..
はいはい
もう帰る。
"По ее взгляду видно что она не все сделала для победы,разочарование в глазах"
烏。
Прыжки тяжелые и низкие
許すな‼️
Long live the queen adelina sotnikova!! ❤🎉😊
予定は未定だから

"Не могут иностранцы все-таки также отлично катать, как наши русские фигуристки. Скучно..."
キムヨナが金メダルを2度取りました、とコメントしている人がいますが、キムヨナの金メダルは一度です❗️訂正が必要です❗️
終わりの始まり
めっちゃ漕ぐけど上手いね。あとループ飛べないの？
"Ладно, тонкая легкая, действительно Крутая программа. Обе заслуживали высшей оценки и исключительного внимания. Но место на пьедестале одно. И оно Аделины"
無知
終わった
Юна достойно отреагировала на 2е место👍
"Kim is beautiful. This performance is truly legendary. But in 2014 she is the second deservedly. Sotnikova had two 3-3 cascades, Kim jumped only one 3-3 cascade. Adeline also had a 3-2-2 cascade, while Kim jumped 2-2-2. In slow motion, the disadvantages of jumping are visible. The protocols are available on the Internet and it is pointless to argue. This is a common offense, nothing more."
"У Аделины гораздо сложнее программа, не надо ляля"
"Carolina Kostner deserved the Gold of Sochi. Kim Yuna the Silver and (arguably), Adelina Sutnikova the bronze."
ソチでは、キムヨナは銀メダルでした。これが正しい情報ですよ❗️
I want to definitely say that I personally don't think she really deserved gold. Mao rightfully earned it.
get  out
"I'm afraid I would never like to watch Kim's performance again. 
On the other hand,  Mao Asada's performance will go down in history."
"True that she has been perfect before the Olympics, but there, at the moment, Sotnikova performed excellently and people must admit, that this is not Yuna's best. She was great, yet still not lucky enough in 2014."
"Шикарная фигуристка,волшебница ,прыжки высокие правильные, Королева,но для меня Снежная ,неприступная, Это ее стиль, Но лично мне не хватило страсти,жизни , танго это ---страсть, Это лично мое мнение, В выступлении Аделины было больше энергии ,жизни, Поэтому и выиграла , Это как Алина и Женя -аыинрала та в ком больше жизни,а не страданий ,холодности , Ещё раз повторюсь,что просто высказала свое мнение, с ним можно не согласиться или согласиться ...."
не Аделина Сотникова лучше!
"И вообще мне меньше нравятся люди которые ярко эмоции не показывают, чем те кто живой и эмоциональный. это мое субъективное. Но если это отложить-обе хороши и заслуживают медаль, но здесь выиграла Аделина"
"Why nobody says that she has wrong flip edge, no 3  loop at all, no spinning with leg high. Heavy landing from lutz. Just blinded by her previous achievments. Can not take the truth."
場末のホステス
"у России - самые сильные спортсмены. иностранцы против нас, и не могут это принять.  А Аделина - заслуженно получила своё олимпийское золото ."
今見ても回転不足多い。キムヨナの採点もソトニコワの採点も甘すぎる
"Ummm...a safe player should have won the Olympic Games? wow the audience favoritism is scary, they can destroy one person for the favor of another one, just because they was fooled by the first glance impression 
These whole situation just shows how people judge before investigate and thinks that they are smarter than everyone in the room"
"Прочитав комментарии, понимаешь, что нет конкретики, где именно засудили Юну. Просто видишь, ну вот она красивая, изящная, зрелое катание и т.д. Где факты, что ее засудили? Где именно? Юна проиграла Сотниковой в прыжках, у Аделины они были более сложные, чем у Ким, а также у Юны была старая программа, а Сотниковой новая, которая ПРЕВОСХОДИТ прокат Юны. Так что, ОЛИМПИЙСКАЯ ЧЕМПИОНКА В ФИГУРНОМ ОДИНОЧНОМ КАТАНИИ ЭТО АДЕЛИНА СОТНИКОВА."
"なんか面倒くさくなってきたからもうコメントしない

私にとって最高な人は真央しかいないから"
うつけ者
"Короткая программа- вау, но в произвольной по технике она проиграла"
"Обыкновенное  катание, ничего   особенного ,  наши  девчонки  вон  что  сейчас  делают,  получила  то  что  заслужила,  и  ненадо  ля   ля ."
"Скучное катание и очень низкие прыжки. Девочка хорошая, но мало харизмы."
"どう見ても真央ちゃんの方が良いと思うのですが…
このコメントは韓国の方達ですか？"
"Не хватило немного для победы. Но очень была близка к золоту. Аделина в тот день была сильнее. А вообще КИМ умница, красавица)"
Не вижу чем она лучше Сотниковой.
"I don’t know. In reviewing both performances again 10 years later, it appears to me that they were fairly equal - both programs were fantastic. Honestly, it’s a coin toss. In retrospect, the controversy now seems without much merit. At the time, I thought Yuna Kim was robbed. I no longer feel that way. Adelina deserved the gold medal. Although, if Yuna Kim had won the gold medal it would have been likewise deserved."
"А я кореянка, юн а ким, катается как швабра, руки болтаются как тряпки, 😂"
"I am the only one thats not that impress with this performance ?? It was not technically great, it had no
Complicated elements or anything that WOW just her grace. I do love Yuna but this was not her best."
"Я не увидела в этом выступлении ничего, что было бы лучше, чем у Аделины. Сотникова заслуженно победила."
"She shouldn't use this song, it's an insult"
소치  은메달 리스트
Adelina Sotnikova better!!
"У меня такое впечатление, что Юна проиграла сочинскую олимпиаду по делу. В первой части программы в каскаде второй прыжок не то в два, не то в два с половиной оборота, а после середины тройной с видимой глазу ошибкой на приземлении.
Да, у Аделины тоже была ошибка на каскаде. Но одна. А два больше одного. Так что, все справедливо."
